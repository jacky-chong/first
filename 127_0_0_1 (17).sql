About the Publisher\r\nMaps\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nAlibaba is an unusual name for a Chinese company. Its founder, Jack\r\nMa, a former English teacher, is an unlikely corporate titan.\r\nYet the house that Jack built is home to the largest virtual\r\nshopping mall in the world, soon to overtake Walmart in the amount\r\nof goods sold. The company’s IPO on the New York Stock Exchange\r\nin September 2014 raised $25 billion, the largest stock market\r\nflotation in history. In the months that followed, Alibaba’s shares\r\nsoared, making it one of the top ten most valuable companies in the\r\nworld, worth almost $300 billion. Alibaba became the most valuable\r\nInternet company in the world after Google, its shares worth more\r\nthan Amazon and eBay combined. Nine days before the IPO, Jack\r\ncelebrated his fiftieth birthday, the soaring value of his stake making\r\nhim the richest man in Asia.\r\nBut since that peak Alibaba’s life as a publicly listed company\r\nhas not gone according to plan. Its shares fell by half from their post-\r\nIPO peak, even briefly falling below the initial offer price. Investor\r\nconcerns were sparked in early 2015 by a surprising entanglement\r\nwith a government agency over intellectual property, then fueled by\r\nthe slowing Chinese economy and volatile stock markets, which\r\ndragged down Alibaba’s shares in their wake.\r\nDespite the ups and downs of the stock market, with a dominant\r\nshare of the e-commerce market, Alibaba is uniquely well positioned\r\nto benefit from the rise of China’s consuming classes. Over 400\r\nmillion people, more than the population of the United States, make\r\npurchases on Alibaba’s websites each year. The tens of millions of\r\npackages generated each day account for almost two-thirds of all\r\nparcel deliveries in China.\r\nAlibaba has transformed the way Chinese shop, giving them\r\naccess to a range and quality of items that previous generations\r\ncould only dream of. Like Amazon in the West, Alibaba brings the\r\nconvenience of home delivery to millions of consumers. Yet this\r\ncomparison understates Alibaba’s impact. Taobao, its online\r\nshopping website, has given many Chinese people their first sense of\r\nbeing truly valued as a customer. Alibaba is playing a pivotal role in\r\nChina’s economic restructuring, helping move the country away from\r\na “Made in China” past to a “Bought in China” present.\r\nThe Old China growth model lasted three decades. Based on\r\nmanufacturing, construction, and exports, it delivered hundreds of\r\nmillions out of poverty but left China with a bitter legacy of\r\novercapacity, overbuilding, and pollution. Now a new model is\r\nemerging, one centered on catering to the needs of a middle class\r\nexpected to grow from 300 million to half a billion people within ten\r\nyears.\r\nJack, more than any other, is the face of the new China. Already\r\nsomething of a folk hero at home, he stands at the intersection of\r\nChina’s newfound cults of consumerism and entrepreneurship.\r\nHis fame extends well beyond China’s borders. A meeting (and a\r\nselfie) with Jack is coveted by presidents, prime ministers and\r\nprinces, CEOs, entrepreneurs, investors, and movie stars. Jack\r\nregularly shares the stage with the world’s political and corporate\r\nelite. A masterful public speaker, more often than not he outshines\r\nthem. To go onstage after Jack is a losing proposition. In a\r\nremarkable reversal of protocol, President Obama even volunteered\r\nto act as moderator for Jack at a Q&A session during the November\r\n2015 APEC meeting in Manila. At the World Economic Forum in\r\nDavos in January 2016, Jack dined with Leonardo DiCaprio, Kevin\r\nSpacey, and Bono, along with the CEOs of the Coca-Cola Company,\r\nDHL, and JPMorgan Chase. The founder of another China Internet\r\ncompany remarked to me: “It was almost as though Alibaba’s PR\r\ndepartment was writing Obama’s script!”\r\nTom Cruise and Jack Ma in Shanghai, September 6, 2015, at the Chinese premiere of\r\nMission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, which was financed in part by Alibaba Pictures. Alibaba\r\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been demonstrating his\r\ncommitment to learning Mandarin Chinese in speeches he has made\r\nsince 2014, starting at Tsinghua University in Beijing. But Jack,\r\nEnglish teacher turned tycoon, has been wowing crowds in both\r\nEnglish and Chinese at conferences around the world for over\r\nseventeen years.\r\nI first met Jack in the summer of 1999, a few months after he\r\nfounded Alibaba in a small apartment in Hangzhou, some hundred\r\nmiles southwest of Shanghai. On my first visit, I could count the\r\nnumber of cofounders by the toothbrushes jammed into mugs on a\r\nshelf in the bathroom. In addition to Jack, there included his wife,\r\nCathy, and sixteen others. Jack and Cathy had wagered everything\r\nthey owned on the company, including their home. Jack’s ambition\r\nthen, as it remains today, was breathtaking. He talked of building an\r\nInternet company that would last eighty years—the typical span of a\r\nhuman life. A few years later, he extended Alibaba’s life expectancy\r\nto “a hundred and two” years, so that the company would span three\r\ncenturies from 1999. From the very beginning, he vowed to take on\r\nand topple the giants of Silicon Valley. Within the confines of that\r\nmodest apartment this should have seemed delusional. Yet there was\r\nsomething about his passion for the venture that made it sound\r\nentirely credible.\r\nI became an adviser to Alibaba in its early years, helping Jack\r\nand his right-hand man, Joe Tsai, with the company’s international\r\nexpansion strategy and recommending to them some of its first\r\nforeign employees. Alibaba has assisted me in my research for this\r\nbook by arranging interviews with senior management and providing\r\naccess to the company in various locations. But this is an entirely\r\nindependent account. I have never been an employee of the\r\ncompany and have no professional relationship with them today. My\r\ninsights come in part from my brief role during the dot-com boom as\r\nan adviser to Alibaba and from the proximity that this early contact\r\nhas afforded since. Yet in writing this book, I have been guided also\r\nby my personal experience living in China since 1994, when the\r\nInternet first came to the country’s shores, and by my professional\r\ncareer. With support from my previous employer Morgan Stanley,1 in\r\nthe summer of 1994, I founded BDA China, a Beijing-based\r\ninvestment advisory firm, which today numbers more than one\r\nhundred professionals, consulting to investors and participants in\r\nChina’s technology and retail sectors.\r\nAs part of the remuneration for my advisory service, in early\r\n2000, Jack and Joe granted me the right to buy a few hundred\r\nthousand shares in Alibaba at just thirty cents each. When the\r\ndeadline was up to buy the shares, in early 2003, things weren’t\r\nlooking so good for the company. The dot-com bubble had burst and\r\nAlibaba’s (original) business was struggling. In an error of colossal\r\nproportions, I decided not to buy the shares. In the weeks after the\r\ncompany’s September 2014 IPO, this mushroomed into a $30 million\r\nmistake.2 I would like to thank you very much for purchasing this\r\nbook. Writing it has proved (somewhat) cathartic as I explore the\r\nstories of others, like Goldman Sachs, who underestimated Jack’s\r\ntenacity and sold their early stake too soon, and eBay, who dismissed\r\nhis firm as a rival, only to be forced out of the China market within a\r\nfew years.\r\nJack is different from most of his Internet billionaire peers. He\r\nstruggled in math as a student and wears his ignorance of technology\r\nas a badge of honor. His outsize ambitions and unconventional\r\nstrategies won him the nickname “Crazy Jack.” In this book, we will\r\nexplore his past and quirky personality to learn the method to his\r\nmadness.\r\nChina’s e-commerce market differs in important ways from the\r\nUnited States and other Western economies, the legacy of decades\r\nof state planning and the important role still played by state-owned\r\nenterprises. Alibaba has sought out and exploited the inefficiencies\r\nthese have created, first in e-commerce, now in media and finance.\r\nHis vision for the company—or his own philanthropic endeavors—\r\nnow extends to grappling with China’s greatest challenges, in\r\nreforming health care, education, and its approach to the\r\nenvironment.\r\nYet Alibaba’s main business today remains e-commerce, a\r\nmarket it helped create and which it currently dominates. Is there\r\nmore room for it to grow? Competitors are waiting in the wings. Also\r\nwatching closely is the Chinese government. As Alibaba consolidates\r\nmore market power than any other private company ever has, can\r\nJack keep the government on his side?\r\nAlthough most of its operations are in China, Alibaba is pursuing\r\nan ambitious international expansion. Newly appointed president\r\nMichael Evans: “We like to say that Alibaba was born in China, but\r\nwe were created for the world.”\r\nBefore we look at the remarkable story of how Alibaba came to\r\nbe, and its goals for the future, let’s start by taking a tour of what Jack\r\ncalls the “iron triangle,” the key underpinning of the company’s\r\ndominance today: its strengths in e-commerce, logistics, and finance.\r\nChapter One\r\nThe Iron Triangle\r\nChina changed because of us in the past fifteen years.\r\nWe hope in the next fifteen years, the world changes because of us.\r\n—Jack Ma\r\nOn November 11, 2015, in Beijing, in the iconic bubble-like structure\r\nbathed in blue light known popularly as the “Water Cube,” the venue\r\nfor the aquatics events in the Beijing Olympics held seven years\r\nearlier, it wasn’t water that flowed but streams of data. For twenty-four\r\nhours, without interruption, a huge digital screen flickered with maps,\r\ncharts, and news crawls, reporting in real time the purchases of\r\nmillions of consumers across China on Alibaba’s websites. In front of\r\nhundreds of journalists broadcasting the event across China and\r\naround the world, the Water Cube had been repurposed as mission\r\ncontrol for the Chinese middle class and the merchants marketing to\r\nthem. A four-hour live TV special, the 11/11 Global Festival Shopping\r\nGala, was broadcast to help keep shoppers up until midnight,\r\nfeaturing actors such as Kevin Spacey, who appeared in a filmed\r\nmontage as his character from House of Cards, President Frank\r\nUnderwood, endorsing Alibaba as the place to buy disposable\r\n“burner” cell phones. The gala show culminated in a skit featuring\r\nJack’s face as the new Bond girl before he appeared in a tuxedo\r\nwalking alongside Bond actor Daniel Craig for some onstage antics in\r\nthe final countdown to midnight.\r\nIn the first eight minutes of 11/11/15, shoppers made more than\r\n$1 billion in purchases on Alibaba’s sites. And they kept on shopping.\r\nAs the world’s largest cash register tallied the takings, Jack—seated\r\nnext to his friend, the actor and martial artist Jet Li—couldn’t resist\r\ntaking a photo of the huge screen with his cell phone. Twenty-four\r\nhours later, 30 million buyers had racked up over $14 billion1 in\r\npurchases, four times greater than 11/11’s U.S. equivalent, Cyber\r\nMonday, which occurred a few weeks later, after Thanksgiving’s Black\r\nFriday discount day.\r\nShortly after midnight, Chinese media reporting the sales figures recorded by Alibaba’s\r\nSingles’ Day promotion on November 11, 2015. Duncan Clark\r\nIn China, November 11 is Singles’ Day,2 a special annual\r\npromotion.3 In the West, the date commemorates veterans of past\r\nwars. But in China, November 11 is the most important day of the\r\nyear for the merchants fighting for the wallets of the country’s newly\r\nminted consumer class.\r\nOn this day, also known as Double Eleven (shuang shiyi),4\r\npeople in China indulge in a frenzy of pure, unadulterated hedonism.\r\nJack summed up the event: “This is a unique day. We want all the\r\nmanufacturers, shop owners to be thankful for the consumers. We\r\nwant the consumers to have a wonderful day.”5\r\nFrom just twenty-seven merchants in 2009, over forty thousand\r\nmerchants and thirty thousand brands now participate in Singles’\r\nDay. Total sales in 2015 were up 60 percent from the $9 billion of the\r\nprevious year. On that occasion, celebrated at Alibaba’s Wetlands\r\ncampus in Hangzhou, the company’s chief strategy officer Dr. Zeng\r\nMing described the scene in terms reminiscent of Dr. Frankenstein\r\nwatching his creation stirring from the dead: “The ecosystem has its\r\nown will to grow.” Alibaba’s executive vice chairman Joe Tsai echoed\r\nthe sentiment: “You’re seeing the unleashing of the consumption\r\npower of the Chinese consumer.”\r\nThis power has long been suppressed. Household spending in\r\nthe United States drives two-thirds of the economy, but in China it\r\nbarely accounts for one-third. Compared to developed countries,\r\nChinese people don’t consume enough. The reason? They save too\r\nmuch and spend too little. To fund their future education, medical\r\nexpenses, or retirement, many families accumulate substantial\r\namounts of mattress money or “precautionary savings.” Also, lacking\r\nthe range or quality of products on offer in the West, consumers in\r\nChina until relatively recently had little enticement to spend more on\r\nthemselves.\r\nAddressing an audience at Stanford University in September\r\n2015, Jack observed that “in the U.S. when the economy is slowing\r\ndown it means people don’t have money to spend.” But, he joked,\r\n“You guys know how to spend tomorrow’s money or future money or\r\nother people’s money. China’s been poor for so many years, we put\r\nour money in the bank.”\r\nOld habits die hard, but a new habit—buying online—is changing\r\nthe way consumers in China behave. Alibaba is at the forefront of this\r\nshift. Its most popular website is Taobao.com, China’s third most\r\nvisited website and the world’s twelfth. A common saying today in\r\nChina is wanneng de taobao,6 meaning “you can find everything on\r\nTaobao.” Amazon has been called “the Everything Store.” Taobao too\r\nsells (almost) everything, everywhere. Just as Google is synonymous\r\nwith searching online, in China to “tao”7 something is shorthand for\r\nsearching for a product online.\r\nAlibaba has a much greater impact on China’s retail sector than\r\nAmazon does in the United States. Thanks to Taobao and its sister\r\nsite, Tmall, Alibaba is effectively China’s largest retailer. Amazon, by\r\ncontrast, only became one of the top ten retailers in America in 2013.\r\nAlthough Alibaba launched Taobao in 2003, it was only five years\r\nlater that it really came into its own. Until then China’s countless\r\nfactories churned out products mostly for buyers overseas, shipped to\r\nstock the shelves of retailers like Walmart and Target. But the global\r\nfinancial crisis in 2008 changed everything. China’s traditional export\r\nmarkets were thrown into a tailspin. Taobao pried open the factory\r\ngates to consumers in China instead. The Chinese government’s\r\nresponse to the 2008 crisis was to double down on the Old China\r\nmodel—pumping money into the economy that fueled a massive real\r\nestate bubble, excess capacity, and yet more pollution. As the bills\r\ncame in, it became clear that the much-needed rebalancing of the\r\nChinese economy toward consumption could no longer be\r\npostponed. And Alibaba is one of the biggest beneficiaries.\r\nJack likes to say that his company’s success was an accident:\r\n“Alibaba might as well be known as ‘one thousand and one\r\nmistakes.’” In its early years, he gave three explanations as to why\r\nthe company survived: “We didn’t have any money, we didn’t have\r\nany technology, and we didn’t have a plan.”\r\nBut let’s look at the three real factors that underpin Alibaba’s\r\nsuccess today: the company’s competitive edge in e-commerce,\r\nlogistics, and finance, what Jack describes as Alibaba’s “iron\r\ntriangle.”\r\nAlibaba’s e-commerce sites offer an unparalleled variety of\r\ngoods to consumers. Its logistics offering ensures those goods are\r\ndelivered quickly and reliably. And the company’s finance subsidiary\r\nensures that buying on Alibaba is easy and worry free.\r\nThe E-commerce Edge\r\nUnlike Amazon, Alibaba’s consumer websites Taobao and Tmall carry\r\nno inventory.8 They serve as platforms for other merchants to sell\r\ntheir wares. Taobao consists of nine million storefronts run by small\r\ntraders or individuals. Attracted by the site’s huge user base, these\r\n“micro merchants” choose to set up their stalls on Taobao in part\r\nbecause it costs them nothing to do so. Alibaba charges them no\r\nfees. But Taobao makes money—a lot of it—from selling advertising\r\nspace, helping promote those merchants who want to stand out from\r\nthe crowd.\r\nMerchants can advertise through paid listings or display ads.\r\nUnder the paid listing model, similar to Google’s AdWords,\r\nadvertisers bid for keywords to give their products a more prominent\r\nplacement on Taobao. They pay Alibaba based on the number of\r\ntimes consumers click on their ads. Merchants can also use a more\r\ntraditional advertising model, paying based on the number of times\r\ntheir ads are displayed on Taobao.\r\nThe old joke about advertising is “I know at least half of my\r\nadvertising budget works . . . I just don’t know which half.” But with\r\n“pay-for-performance” advertising—and a ready market of hundreds\r\nof millions of consumers—Taobao commands an enormous appeal to\r\nsmall merchants.\r\nKeeping order amid Taobao’s virtual alleyways are Alibaba’s\r\nclient service managers, the xiaoer.9 Thousands of xiaoer mediate\r\nany disputes that arise between customers and merchants. These\r\nreferees, young employees averaging twenty-seven years old, work\r\nlong hours, often sending messages to vendors late at night.\r\nThe xiaoer have great powers of enforcement, including the\r\nability to shut down a merchant entirely. They can also offer\r\nmerchants a carrot: the ability to participate in marketing campaigns.\r\nInevitably, some merchants have sought to corrupt the xiaoer by\r\noffering bribes. Alibaba periodically shuts down merchants caught in\r\nthe act, and an internal disciplinary unit is constantly on the lookout to\r\nroot out graft among its employees.\r\nBut Taobao’s success is not explained by the xiaoer alone. The\r\nsite works because it succeeds in putting the customer first, bringing\r\nthe vibrancy of China’s street markets to the experience of shopping\r\nonline. Buying online is as interactive as in real life. Customers can\r\nuse Alibaba’s chat application10 to haggle over prices; a vendor might\r\nhold up a product to his webcam. Shoppers can also expect to score\r\ndiscounts and free shipping. Most packages arrive with some extra\r\nsamples or cuddly toys thrown in, something I have personally grown\r\nso used to that when receiving Amazon packages in the United\r\nStates I shake empty boxes in vain. The merchants on Taobao guard\r\ntheir reputation with customers fiercely; such is the Darwinian nature\r\nof the competition on the platform. When customers post a negative\r\ncomment about a merchant or a product, they can expect to receive a\r\nmessage and offers of refunds or free replacements within minutes.\r\nAlibaba’s e-commerce edge is also honed by another of its\r\nwebsites, Tmall.11 If Taobao can be compared to a collection of\r\nscrappy market stalls, Tmall is a glitzy shopping mall. Large retailers\r\nand even luxury brands sell their goods on Tmall and, for those\r\ncustomers not yet able to afford them, build brand awareness. Unlike\r\nTaobao, which is free for buyers and sellers, merchants pay\r\ncommissions to Alibaba on the products they sell on Tmall, ranging\r\nfrom 3 to 6 percent depending on the category.12 Today Tmall.com is\r\nthe seventh-most-visited website in China.\r\nIn Chinese, the site is called tian mao, or “sky cat.” Its mascot is\r\na black cat, to distinguish it from Taobao’s alien doll. Tmall is\r\nincreasingly important for Alibaba, generating $136 billion in gross\r\nmerchandise volume for the company,13 closing in on the $258 billion\r\nsold on Taobao. Alibaba earns almost $10 billion a year in revenue\r\nfrom these sites, nearly 80 percent of its total sales.\r\nTmall hosts three types of stores on its platform: flagship stores,\r\nrun by a brand itself; authorized stores, set up by a merchant licensed\r\nto do so by the brand; and specialty stores, which carry the goods of\r\nmore than one brand. The specialty stores account for 90 percent of\r\nTmall vendors. More than seventy thousand brands, from China and\r\noverseas, can be found today on Tmall.\r\nIn the Singles’ Day promotion on Tmall, the most popular brands\r\nincluded foreign names such as Nike, Gap, Uniqlo, and L’Oréal as\r\nwell as domestic players such as smartphone vendors Xiaomi and\r\nHuawei, and consumer electronics and home appliances company\r\nHaier.\r\nTmall is a veritable A to Z of brands, from Apple to Zara. Luxury\r\nbrands also sell on the website, although they are careful14 not to\r\ncannibalize sales in their physical stores. The presence of Burberry\r\non the site is a sign that Alibaba is no longer just about cheap goods.\r\nU.S. retailers like Costco and Macy’s are also on Tmall, part of a\r\ndrive by Alibaba to connect them along with other overseas stores to\r\ncustomers in China. Costco’s Tmall store drew over 90 million visitors\r\nto its site in the first two months.\r\nEven Amazon is on Tmall, selling imported food, shoes, toys,\r\nand kitchenware since 2015. Amazon has long had designs on the\r\nChina market but has had to settle for just 2 percent of it.\r\nIn addition to Taobao and Tmall, Alibaba operates a Grouponstyle15\r\nsite called Juhuasuan.com.16 Juhuasuan is the largest\r\nproduct-focused group-buying site in China. Buoyed by the huge\r\nvolume of goods on Alibaba’s other sites, it has signed up more than\r\n200 million users, making it the largest online group-buying site in the\r\nworld. Together, Taobao, Tmall, and Juhuasuan have signed up over\r\n10 million merchants, offering more than one billion individual items\r\nfor sale.\r\nAlibaba’s websites are popular in part because, as in the United\r\nStates, shopping online from home can save time and money. More\r\nthan 10 percent of retail purchases in China are made online, higher\r\nthan the 7 percent in the States. Jack has likened e-commerce to a\r\n“dessert” in the United States, whereas in China it is the “main\r\ncourse.” Why? Shopping in China was never a pleasurable\r\nexperience. Until the arrival of multinational companies like Carrefour\r\nand Walmart, there were very few retailing chains or shopping malls.\r\nMost domestic retailers started as state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\r\nWith access to a ready supply of financing, provided by local\r\ngovernments or state-owned banks, they tended to view shoppers as\r\na mere inconvenience. Other retailers were set up by real estate\r\ncompanies more concerned with the value of the land underneath\r\ntheir store than with the customers within.\r\nA key factor in the success of e-commerce in China is the burden\r\nof real estate on traditional retailers. Land is expensive in China\r\nbecause it is a crucial source of income for the government. Land\r\nsales account for one-quarter of the government’s fiscal revenues. At\r\nthe local government level they account for more than one-third. One\r\nprominent e-commerce executive summed it up for me: “Because of\r\nthe way our economy is structured, the government has a lot of\r\nresources. The government decides the price of land. The\r\ngovernment decides how resources are channeled, where money is\r\nspent. The government relies too heavily on taxes and fees\r\nassociated with selling land. That almost destroyed the retail\r\nbusiness in China, and pushed a lot of demand online. They deprived\r\noffline retailers of the opportunity to benefit from rising consumer\r\ndemand—which they effectively channeled to e-commerce players.”\r\nSuccessful brick-and-mortar retailers—from department stores to\r\nrestaurants—suffer from success: If they bring in lots of customers to\r\ntheir store, they can expect a hefty rent hike when their lease is up for\r\nrenegotiation.\r\nAs a consequence, there has been far less investment in\r\nmarketing, customer service, human resources, or logistics in China’s\r\ntraditional retail sector than in the West. The result? China’s retail\r\nmarket is highly fragmented and inefficient. In the United States, the\r\ntop three grocery chains account for 37 percent of all sales. In China,\r\nthey account for just 7 percent. The largest department stores in the\r\nUnited States represent 44 percent of total sales in that segment. In\r\nChina? Just 6 percent.\r\nDespite massive construction of shopping malls, supermarkets,\r\nand corner stores, China’s offline retail penetration is still extremely\r\nlow. For every person in China there are only six square feet of retail\r\nspace, less than one-quarter the space in the United States.17\r\nChina will likely never close the gap. Why should it? Traditional\r\nretail is hardly a paragon of efficiency. With the burdens of inventory\r\nand rental costs, offline stores are rapidly losing sales to online\r\nplayers in many product categories.\r\nIn China today, some shop owners are too busy taking care of\r\ncustomers online to bother with those who actually wander into their\r\nstore. Many vendors in China have simply dispensed with the shop\r\nentirely: Why rent an expensive space that is only open at most half\r\nof every day when your Taobao storefront is open 24/7?\r\nNature abhors a vacuum and in China the Internet is filling the\r\nvoids created by a legacy of state ownership and state planning.\r\nThat’s why shopping online in China is even more popular than in the\r\nWest. Jack summed it up: “In other countries, e-commerce is a way to\r\nshop; in China it is a lifestyle.”\r\nTaobao opened the door to online shopping in China, and Tmall\r\nhas widened it even further. Taobao’s early adopters were young,\r\ndigital natives, but increasingly their parents and grandparents are\r\nbuying online, too. As the mix of people buying online has broadened,\r\nso has the mix of products. The most popular items on Alibaba’s sites\r\nare shoes and clothing, ranging all the way up from socks and Tshirts\r\nto dresses costing tens of thousands of dollars. The day after\r\nthe country’s biggest television broadcast, the Spring Festival Gala\r\non China Central Television, the dresses worn by the celebrities—or\r\napproximations of them—are already on sale on Alibaba’s sites.\r\nMany storefronts feature photos of people—including the merchants\r\nthemselves—modeling a wide range of body sizes to make it easy to\r\nbuy online. Customers know that if the clothes don’t fit, or are\r\ndefective, they can return them without charge.\r\nGroceries are another popular category because, as Jack\r\nexplained, “supermarkets in China were terrible; that’s why we have\r\ncome out on top.” Already more than 40 percent of Chinese\r\nconsumers buy their groceries online as compared to just 10 percent\r\nin the United States. In 2014, online grocery sales in China grew by\r\nhalf. Offline, they grew only 7 percent. Tmall offers grocery items in\r\nmore than 250 cities in all but six of China’s thirty-two mainland\r\nprovinces, typically at cheaper prices than in a supermarket. Alibaba\r\nalready offers next-day delivery of refrigerated items in more than\r\nsixty cities and also features a wide range of imported foods. Working\r\nwith the Washington State Apple Commission, Alibaba secured more\r\nthan eighty-four thousand individual orders for apples that were\r\npicked, packed, and freighted to customers in China within seventytwo\r\nhours, amounting to 167 metric tons and equivalent in volume to\r\nthe capacity of three Boeing 747s.\r\nYoung mothers are a key customer base for Alibaba. James\r\nChiu, a representative from the Dutch infant formula company Friso,\r\nwhich was showcased by Alibaba on Singles’ Day 2015, said that for\r\nyoung mothers in China, “e-commerce is not a channel, it’s a lifestyle,\r\nan ecosystem.” The group sold almost $10 million worth of products\r\non Singles’ Day by 6 A.M. alone, more than their 2014 total.\r\nComputers, communication products, and consumer electronics\r\nare popular items on Taobao, as are household goods, from hair\r\ndryers and microwave ovens to TVs and washing machines. Here the\r\nimpact on offline retailers has been especially dramatic. On Singles’\r\nDay, Alibaba’s sales of home appliances regularly exceed half of the\r\nannual sales of the country’s largest consumer goods retailers. In\r\nAugust 2015, Alibaba acquired 20 percent of retailer Suning for $4.6\r\nbillion. Selling electronics and white goods as well as books and baby\r\nproducts, Suning operates more than sixteen hundred stores in\r\nalmost three hundred cities. The deal with Alibaba, part of the\r\ngrowing “omni-channel” or “online to offline” (“O2O”) trend, means\r\nthat even if customers go to Suning merely to test out a product, the\r\ncompany can capture some of the revenue when they buy the item\r\nonline.\r\nAlibaba sells automobiles online, too. General Motors brands\r\nChevrolet and Buick both operate stores on Tmall, where they also\r\nmarket interest-free auto loans, a critical competitive tool in a market\r\nthat is already GM’s largest. Automobiles are a popular category on\r\nSingles’ Day, as buyers can expect to score discounts as well as\r\nbeneficial payment terms. Real estate is another category. The\r\nsuperrich can browse lists of entire islands for sale in Canada, Fiji, or\r\nGreece.\r\nTaobao is famous for offering all sorts of outlandish items, too.\r\nOne university student gained notoriety for offering earrings that\r\nfeature dead mosquitoes—like the insects, each pair is unique.\r\nAnother vendor even sold bottled farts online.\r\nTaobao isn’t just about products. Customers can also buy\r\nservices, too. Artists and musicians find commissions on the site. The\r\nsheer variety of services on offer provides a revealing insight into\r\nChina’s fast-changing social mores. Young men can hire a fake\r\ngirlfriend to attend social events, or outsource a breakup with their\r\nreal girlfriend to a specialist on Taobao. Wives worried about a\r\nstraying husband can subscribe to a counseling service offering\r\ntechniques to fend off a mistress. Busy young urbanites can hire\r\nsurrogates on Taobao to visit their parents. To overcome a chronic\r\nlack of donors, Alibaba’s group buying site, Juhuasuan, even teamed\r\nup with sperm banks in seven provinces to entice qualified donors\r\nwith an offer of more than eight hundred dollars. This is the going rate\r\noffline, but with the power of online marketing more than twenty-two\r\nthousand men had applied within forty-eight hours.\r\nFeel-good items such as cosmetics and jewelry are popular\r\nitems on Taobao, too. Merchants are drawn to the category for\r\ncommanding some of the highest margins for any product sold online.\r\nToday an estimated 42 percent of skin-care products in China are\r\nsold online, a number boosted by the wide availability of goods sold\r\nby merchants who have found a way to circumvent high import\r\nduties.\r\nCounterfeit goods are thought to be the world’s largest illicit\r\nindustry, more profitable by some estimates than the drug trade.\r\nSales by merchants of pirated goods on Taobao helped boost the\r\nearly popularity of the website and continue to be a bone of\r\ncontention for brand owners. China’s fake goods can be so high\r\nquality that they defy detection even by legitimate manufacturers,\r\nmade by “extra shift” production runs in the same plant as the real\r\nitems, typically using leftover materials. As workshop to the world,\r\nChina is a big part of the piracy problem. But as it becomes the\r\nworld’s largest consumer base, it has to be part of the solution, too.\r\nSpeaking at a fair for online merchants in Guangzhou, Jack\r\nonce18 addressed these concerns: “Are there any counterfeit\r\nproducts [on Taobao]? Of course there are. This is a complicated\r\nsociety. Taobao itself does not make fake products, but Taobao is\r\nproviding some degree of convenience for those who make fake\r\nproducts. Taobao is a digital platform.” Jack then urged the\r\nmerchants who sell genuine products on Taobao to unite, enforce\r\nregulations, and kick out the merchants who sell fakes, telling them:\r\n“We keep track of all of you who make and sell fake products. You will\r\nbe punished.”\r\nBut Alibaba’s efforts have not always convinced brand owners. In\r\nNovember 2011, the same month that Baidu was removed from its\r\nlist, Taobao was added to the “Notorious Markets List”19 published by\r\nthe Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR),\r\nAmerica’s chief trade negotiator. Inclusion on the notorious markets\r\nlist not only threatened to damage Alibaba’s reputation with\r\nmerchants, but also complicated its plans for an IPO. In response, the\r\ncompany ramped up its efforts to weed out the largest traders of\r\ncounterfeit items from Taobao, prompting a number of them to form\r\nan “Anti-Taobao Alliance” and march on Alibaba’s offices in Hong\r\nKong in protest. Alibaba also raised the bar for vendors selling on\r\nTmall, increasing service charges and deposits, a move that triggered\r\nan angry response from thousands of merchants who accused\r\nTaobao of monopoly practices and marched on Alibaba’s\r\nheadquarters in Hangzhou.\r\nTo appease the USTR Alibaba also ramped up its lobbying\r\nefforts20 and in December 2012 Taobao was removed from its list—\r\nalthough a number of U.S. software, clothing, and shoe\r\nmanufacturers have continued since then to push for sanctions\r\nagainst Taobao to be reimposed.\r\nAs the perennial tensions over piracy highlight, the sheer volume\r\nof goods on sale on its platforms means Alibaba has to strike a\r\ndelicate balance between serving the interests of consumers and\r\nmerchants as well as protecting its own reputation. Binding Alibaba\r\neven closer to buyers and sellers is the second edge of the iron\r\ntriangle: logistics.\r\nThe Logistics Edge\r\nOn Singles’ Day 2015, orders placed on Alibaba’s websites\r\ngenerated 467 million packages, requiring more than 1.7 million\r\ncouriers and four hundred thousand vehicles to deliver the goods.\r\nChina today has a veritable army of couriers. On foot, bicycles,\r\nelectronic bikes, trucks, and trains they are the unsung heroes of the\r\ncountry’s e-commerce revolution.\r\nChinese consumers spent more than $32 billion on package\r\ndeliveries in 2014. The number increased by more than 40 percent in\r\na year. But the volume is set to grow dramatically in the years ahead:\r\nOn average less than one package per month is delivered for every\r\nperson in China.\r\nWithout the low-cost delivery that the courier services provide,\r\nAlibaba would not be the giant it is today. To survive in a cutthroat\r\nindustry, some of the courier firms have adopted clever methods to\r\nkeep costs at rock bottom. In Shanghai, for instance, couriers shuttle\r\nback and forth on the subway, passing packages over the barriers to\r\none another to avoid buying multiple tickets.\r\nBut none of these couriers are employed by Alibaba itself. Most\r\nof the packages in China are delivered by private couriers. Where forprofit\r\ndelivery services have yet to be rolled out, mostly in the\r\ncountryside, China Post handles the rest.\r\nIn 2005, Alibaba approached China Post, proposing to work\r\ntogether on e-commerce. But, chief strategy officer Zeng Ming\r\nrecalled, Jack “was laughed at. They actually told him to stick to his\r\nown business. They didn’t believe in express delivery.” China’s\r\ncourier companies saw the same opportunities that prompted\r\ncompanies like Wells Fargo to launch their own private parcel delivery\r\nand banking services during the California Gold Rush in the midnineteenth\r\ncentury, in response to the inefficiency of what was then\r\nthe United States Post Office. In China, the e-commerce gold rush\r\nhas stimulated the rise of more than eight thousand private courier\r\nfirms, of which twenty major companies stand out.\r\nAlibaba’s home province of Zhejiang is home also to most of\r\nChina’s largest courier companies. They play a critical role in\r\ndelivering goods all over the country. Over half of the package\r\ndelivery market in China is carried out by just four companies, known\r\nas the “Three Tongs, One Da”: Shentong (STO Express), Yuantong\r\n(YTO Express), Zhongtong (ZTO Express), and Yunda. Remarkably\r\nall come from the same town, Tonglu, not far from Hangzhou. More\r\nthan two-thirds of their business comes from Taobao and Tmall.\r\nTogether with two other smaller delivery companies they are often\r\nreferred to as the “Tonglu Gang.”\r\nThe Tonglu Gang along with a company called SF Express21\r\nhave played a major role in Taobao’s success. ZTO cofounder Lai\r\nJianfa described the relationship: “Delivery companies are a\r\npropeller. We are the strongest force driving Alibaba’s fast\r\ndevelopment.”\r\nAlibaba has invested together with these companies and others\r\nin a firm called China Smart Logistics, or “Cainiao.”22 The combined\r\nhauling power of the fifteen logistics partners in Cainiao is staggering.\r\nTogether they handle more than 30 million packages a day and\r\nemploy more than 1.5 million people across six hundred cities.23\r\nCainiao is building a propriety information platform that knits together\r\nlogistics providers, warehouses, and distribution centers across the\r\ncountry. Alibaba owns 48 percent of Cainiao, which, with the\r\ninvolvement of the Tonglu Gang and other self-made billionaires from\r\nthe province, gives the company a distinctively Zhejiang flavor.24 The\r\nZhejiang-born billionaire Shen Guojun25 is a major investor in\r\nCainiao, and served as its inaugural CEO. Fosun, best known\r\noverseas for its purchase of Club Med, is a 10 percent shareholder.\r\nFosun’s chairman, Guo Guangchang, is also a native of Zhejiang. In\r\nDecember 2015, Guo was apparently detained for questioning by the\r\nChinese authorities before being released several days later with no\r\nexplanation, causing a sharp decline in Fosun’s share price.\r\nWhen it was launched in 2013, Cainiao announced plans to\r\ninvest more than $16 billion by 2020 to develop the “China Smart\r\nLogistics Network,” comprising three networks—Peoplenet,26\r\nGroundnet,27 and Skynet. Cainiao has not merged the courier\r\ncompanies, instead its strategy is to integrate the data that each\r\ngenerates—focusing on data packets, not physical packages. The\r\nidea is that by sharing orders, delivery status, and customer feedback\r\neach member company can improve efficiency and service quality,\r\nwhile remaining separately owned.\r\nBy investing in Cainiao, Alibaba aims to lock in vital relationships\r\nwith its logistics partners while finding outside investors to fund the\r\nexpansion of the networks themselves. Cainiao neither owns the\r\nphysical infrastructure of the networks nor employs the personnel\r\nwho make the deliveries. Those assets are contributed by the\r\nconsortium’s members and partners, allowing Alibaba to pursue an\r\n“asset-light” strategy.\r\nA lot is riding on this approach. Alibaba’s principal e-commerce\r\ncompetitor, JD.com,28 is pursuing an “asset-heavy” strategy, investing\r\ndirectly in its own logistics infrastructure. JD’s mascot is Joy, a gray\r\nmetallic dog, chosen no doubt to give symbolic chase to Tmall’s black\r\ncat. Today JD has built up the largest warehousing capacity29 of any\r\ne-commerce company in China, offering speedy delivery services\r\nincluding same-day30 delivery in forty-three cities. JD.com runs a truly\r\nend-to-end system, controlling its own procurement, inventory,\r\ndistribution, and warehouse systems, with goods delivered to\r\ncustomers by uniformed couriers riding JD-branded vehicles.\r\nWith annual revenues topping $11 billion, JD has a growing\r\nshare of the consumer e-commerce market. The company is\r\nespecially strong in tier-one cities like Beijing and in product\r\ncategories such as home appliances and electronics.\r\nAlibaba’s investment in the electronics retailer Suning, which it\r\nwatches warily, illustrates its concern. Both Alibaba and JD are vying\r\nto ensure deliveries in as little as two to three hours in a number of\r\ncities.\r\nAlibaba is attempting to build a whole a new competitive playing\r\nfield by harnessing data technology, including Big Data—the ability to\r\nanalyze and drive business decisions from the huge volumes of\r\ninformation generated every day on its websites. On Singles’ Day, the\r\ndelivery paths of most of the courier companies within the Cainiao\r\nnetwork were analyzed and rerouted in the event of traffic jams.\r\nAlibaba justifies its investment in Cainiao by arguing that demand\r\nwould otherwise have run ahead of the courier companies’ ability to\r\ndeliver the packages. This is borne out by feedback from merchants\r\nselling major appliances, such as refrigerators, during Singles’ Day in\r\n2015 who reported that less than 2 percent of the shipments handled\r\nby Cainiao arrived late or were damaged, compared to 15 percent of\r\nthe shipments handled by other courier companies. From some 30\r\nmillion packages on a typical day at present, Alibaba expects it will\r\ngenerate more than 100 million packages of orders a day by 2020.\r\nAn estimated 30 percent of current delivery routes are inefficient\r\nor uneconomic. Like Amazon in the United States, Cainiao member\r\ncompanies are experimenting with deliveries by drone aircraft—\r\nalthough higher population density in China, especially in coastal\r\nareas, means this is not as big a priority as in the United States. In\r\n2015, YTO, one of the Tonglu Gang companies, ran a three-day trial\r\ninvolving deliveries of ginger tea by drone to a few hundred\r\ncustomers within one hour’s flight of Alibaba’s distribution centers in\r\nBeijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. For now drones in China remain\r\njust a gimmick. Innovations in logistics—such as shaving off delivery\r\ntimes or cutting costs—are likely to be more incremental than\r\nrevolutionary.\r\nYet with Cainiao Alibaba has shored up the most important asset\r\nof all: trust. Customers and merchants know they can count on the\r\nproducts getting where they need to be, on time.\r\nThe Finance Edge\r\nThe final edge in the iron triangle is finance. In financial services,\r\nAlibaba’s most important asset is Alipay, its answer to PayPal. By far\r\nthe most popular online payment tool in China, Alipay handles more\r\nthan three-quarters of a trillion dollars a year in online transactions,31\r\nthree times the volume of PayPal and one-third of the $2.5 trillion\r\nglobal online payments market. In the peak early minutes of Singles’\r\nDay 2015, Alipay handled over eighty-five thousand payments per\r\nsecond.\r\nAs a form of escrow, Alipay diffuses trust throughout Alibaba’s ecommerce\r\nempire. Consumers know that when they pay with Alipay\r\ntheir accounts will be debited only when they have received and are\r\nsatisfied with the products they have ordered. Only then, after\r\nfreezing the amount on the account, will Alipay release the funds to\r\nthe merchant. Customers buying on Alibaba’s consumer sites can\r\nreturn goods up to seven days after purchase, provided they are not\r\ndamaged.\r\nNo longer owned by Alibaba,32 Alipay is the largest asset of a\r\ncompany, controlled personally by Jack, which has been valued by\r\none analyst at $45 billion. Alibaba websites account for more than\r\none-third of its revenues, but other sites also rely heavily on Alipay to\r\nprocess their online payments. People use Alipay to make money\r\ntransfers, top up their cell phone accounts, and make cashless\r\npurchases using bar codes at retailers and restaurants, like KFC.\r\nTwenty percent of all Alipay transactions involve paying for utilities,\r\nsuch as water, electricity, and gas bills. Customers can also buy train\r\ntickets, pay traffic fines, or purchase insurance using Alipay, making it\r\nthe de facto currency of an increasingly digital China. Thanks to\r\ncommissions on payments it handles, Alipay, which is already highly\r\nprofitable, is expected to generate almost $5 billion a year in\r\nrevenues33 by 2018.\r\nWith the growth of smartphones in China, used by more than 830\r\nmillion people, the value of Alipay goes far beyond that of a simple\r\npayment tool. Because consumers keep cash balances on their\r\naccounts, Alipay has become a virtual wallet for over 300 million\r\npeople, the thin end of a wedge that Alibaba is driving into China’s\r\nfinancial services market.\r\nIn the same way Alibaba has exploited the inefficiency of offline\r\nretail, offline banking has proved a ripe fruit for it to pick. Just as\r\nstate-owned shops paid little interest in their customers, China’s\r\nstate-owned banks paid little heed to the needs of individuals and\r\nsmall businesses. Until recently, they had no choice but to place their\r\ncash deposits with the banks that were focused on state-owned\r\nenterprises. The political masters of the SOEs are also their own.\r\nThe “big four” state-owned banks—the Industrial and\r\nCommercial Bank of China (ICBC), Construction Bank, Bank of\r\nChina, and Agricultural Bank of China—control about 70 percent of\r\nthe market. The disdain of these banks for their customers has fueled\r\npopular jokes such as the one about ICBC’s initials standing for, in\r\nChinese, “ai cun bu cun,” translating loosely as “who cares if you\r\nsave with us or not, whatever.” Traditionally, these and other stateowned\r\nbanks paid out very low rates of interest, at times below the\r\nrate of inflation. This “financial repression” has skewed China’s\r\neconomy, transferring wealth from consumers to the SOEs, which\r\nhave squandered much of it in the loss-making investments of the\r\nOld China model.\r\nThe Chinese government recognizes the need for reform, and\r\nthe need for more rational capital allocation. But to do so it has to\r\ntake on a powerful vested interest: itself. Alibaba has already been\r\ncaught in the middle. Offering much higher returns on deposits than\r\nthe meager returns paid by the banks, Alibaba’s Yu’e Bao online\r\nmutual fund proved so popular when it launched in 2013 that it stirred\r\nChina’s stagnant financial service industry into a frenzy of activity.\r\nYu’e Bao, whose name translates in English as “savings balance\r\ntreasure,” sounds innocuous enough: a place to deposit your loose\r\nchange. But when it launched the product Alibaba set no limits on the\r\namount customers could deposit. Not only were the rates it offered\r\nmuch higher than the banks—as much as two percentage points\r\nhigher—but Yu’e Bao allowed customers to make withdrawals at any\r\ntime without penalty. As a result, individual customers transferred\r\ntens or hundreds of thousands of dollars into the fund. The banks\r\nbecame alarmed at the outflows. By February 2014, Yu’e Bao34 had\r\nattracted over $93 billion from 80 million investors, more than the\r\ncombined total accounts of all other money managers in China. The\r\ninflow was so huge that in only ten months Yu’e Bao was ranked the\r\nfourth largest money manager in the world, closing in on global\r\nindustry stalwarts such as Vanguard, Fidelity, and J.P. Morgan.\r\nPrior to the fund’s launch Jack took the unusual step, for a\r\nprivate sector entrepreneur, of penning an opinion piece in the\r\nCommunist Party journal People’s Daily arguing, “The finance\r\nindustry needs disrupters, it needs outsiders to come in and carry out\r\na transformation.” Soon after, the SOE empire struck back,\r\ndenouncing the fund managers behind Yu’e Bao as “vampires\r\nsucking blood out of the banks.” Starting in March 2014, the stateowned\r\nbanks, holding collectively more than $100 trillion in deposits,\r\nimposed limits on the amounts their customers could transfer into\r\nthird-party online payment accounts. Other government-imposed\r\nrestrictions followed soon after. Pulling no punches, Jack posted a\r\nmessage on social media criticizing the banks by name and blaming\r\nthem for failing to participate in China’s market-oriented financial\r\nliberalization: “The decision of who wins and who loses in the market\r\nshouldn’t be up to monopoly and authority, but up to customers.” Jack\r\ndeleted it soon after, but the message was reposted widely. Alibaba\r\nhas continued to push the boundaries of private sector involvement in\r\nfinancial services, including providing microloans to the merchants\r\nand consumers trading on its platforms. Still relatively new, the\r\nlending business is expected to grow into a billion-dollar business\r\nwithin a few years. Offering credit also increases the “stickiness,” or\r\nloyalty from customers, of Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms.\r\nBecause it has access to the entire trading history of its\r\ncustomers, Alibaba is in a much better position to assess credit risk\r\nthan the banks. A new business, Sesame Credit Management,\r\nprovides credit ratings on consumers and merchants to third parties.\r\nOther financial services offerings35 include wealth management,\r\npeer-to-peer lending businesses, and insurance.36 In 2015 Jack\r\nlaunched an Internet-only bank called MYbank, which gets rid of the\r\nneed for branches entirely. MYbank plans to use smartphones to\r\nauthenticate customers’ identities.37\r\nThe iron triangle is a key factor in making Alibaba such a\r\ndominant player in China’s e-commerce market. But it is the charisma\r\nof the company’s founder—his “Jack Magic”—that bound together the\r\npeople and capital who would build on these foundations.\r\nChapter Two\r\nJack Magic\r\nCome up with an idea, make it fun, and breathe something into it\r\nwhich otherwise is still just an idea. That’s Jack Magic.\r\n—Jan Van der Ven\r\nMost companies bear the imprint of their founders, but few more than\r\nAlibaba. Jack Ma’s outsize influence stems from his passion for\r\nteaching. Although he left the profession two decades ago, Jack has\r\nnever really stopped being an educator. He used to joke that in his\r\ncase CEO stood for “Chief Education Officer.” Fourteen years after\r\nfounding the company Jack relinquished the title to become\r\nchairman. But the switch served only to heighten his authority. His\r\nchosen successor as CEO lasted barely two years in the job.\r\nE.T.\r\nJack is, without doubt, the face of Alibaba. Short and thin, Jack has\r\nbeen described in the media over the years as an “imp of a man,” “a\r\ntiny figure with sunken cheekbones, tussled hair and a mischievous\r\ngrin,” his looks “owlish,” “puckish,” or “elfish.” Jack has turned his\r\ndistinctive looks to his advantage. At the launch of MYbank, which\r\naims to sign up customers exclusively through facial recognition\r\ntechnology, Alibaba showcased the fact that Jack “who had been\r\nunable to live off his face was now going to live off his face.”\r\nSome in China like to refer to Jack as “E.T.,” after a supposed\r\nresemblance to the lead creature in the Steven Spielberg movie.\r\nEven his Zhejiang-born billionaire friend Guo Guangchang1 has\r\ncalled Jack an “alien,” but only before dismissing himself as “just a\r\nnormal guy . . . no one is as smart as Jack Ma.”\r\nSo, Jack doesn’t look the part of a corporate chieftain. He\r\npossesses all the trappings, including luxury homes around the world\r\nand a Gulfstream jet, but otherwise Jack doesn’t really act the part,\r\neither. One of the most circulated images of Jack on the Internet is a\r\nphoto of him sporting a Mohawk, nose ring, and makeup, including\r\njet-black lipstick. On that occasion, a celebration of Alibaba’s tenth\r\nanniversary, Jack sang Elton John’s “Can You Feel the Love Tonight”\r\nto a stadium full of seventeen thousand cheering employees and ten\r\nthousand other spectators.\r\nJack combines a love of showmanship with a relish for defying\r\nstereotypes. Where other business moguls like to talk up their\r\nconnections or academic credentials, Jack enjoys talking down his\r\nown: “I don’t have a rich or powerful father, not even a powerful\r\nuncle.” Having never studied abroad, he likes to describe himself as\r\n“one hundred percent Made in China.” He stands out as a tech\r\ncompany founder with no background in technology. At Stanford\r\nUniversity in 2013 he confessed, “Even today, I still don’t understand\r\nwhat coding is all about, I still don’t understand the technology behind\r\nthe Internet.”\r\nJack has made a career out of being underestimated: “I am a\r\nvery simple guy, I am not smart. Everyone thinks that Jack Ma is a\r\nvery smart guy. I might have a smart face but I’ve got very stupid\r\nbrains.”\r\nBlarney Meets Chutzpah in China\r\nHis achievements have proved otherwise—this dumbing down is of\r\ncourse just a feint. Jack once explained2 that he loves the lead\r\ncharacter of the movie Forrest Gump because “people think he is\r\ndumb, but he knows what he is doing.” In his early speeches\r\npromoting Alibaba, Jack referred so often to Forrest Gump that I\r\ncame to think of his stump speech as his “Gump speech.” Much has\r\nchanged for Alibaba, but Gump’s appeal endures. On the first day of\r\ntrading of Alibaba’s shares, Jack was interviewed by CNBC live on\r\nthe floor of the New York Stock Exchange. When he was asked which\r\nperson had most inspired him, Jack replied without hesitation,\r\n“Forrest Gump.” His interviewer paused, then said, “You know he’s a\r\nfictional character?”\r\nJack’s ability to charm and cajole has played an important role in\r\nattracting talent and capital to the company, as well as building his\r\nown fame. Jack has a unique Chinese combination of blarney and\r\nchutzpah. One of his earliest foreign employees3 summed up for me\r\nhis qualities in two words: “Jack Magic.” In this respect, Jack shares a\r\ncharacteristic with Steve Jobs, whose charisma and means of getting\r\nhis way were famously described by a member of the original Apple\r\nMacintosh design team as a “Reality Distortion Field.”\r\nCentral to Jack’s own distortion field are his skills as a\r\ncommunicator. Jack’s speaking style is so effective because his\r\nmessage is so easy to agree with, remember, and digest. Collections\r\nof his quotes circulate widely online, in English as well as in Chinese.\r\nMost are bite-size messages of inspiration, words that wouldn’t be out\r\nof place on a motivational poster, such as “Believe in your dream and\r\nbelieve in yourself,” or “Learn from others the tactics and the skills,\r\nbut don’t change your dream.” Other popular quotes read more like\r\nan Aesop fable: “If there are nine rabbits on the ground, if you want to\r\ncatch one, just focus on one. Change your tactics if you need to, but\r\ndon’t change the rabbit. . . . Get one first, put it in your pocket, and\r\nthen catch the others.” People have even taken to inventing carpe\r\ndiem–style quotes from Jack to justify, for example, the purchase of a\r\npair of expensive shoes.\r\nJack always speaks without notes. His oratorical skills are so\r\neffective because his repertoire is so narrow. Jack can dispense with\r\nnotes because he already knows much of his material: a well-honed\r\nstable of stock stories, mostly tales from his childhood or Alibaba’s\r\nown infancy. A close inspection of all of his speeches reveals he has\r\nessentially been giving the same speech for the last seventeen years.\r\nYet by subtly tweaking his message to match the mood and\r\nexpectations of the crowd, he somehow manages to make each\r\nspeech sound fresh.\r\nJack is a master at appealing to people’s emotions, which is not\r\nsomething you’d expect from the founder of a company that started\r\nout focusing on international trade. Sometimes, as he’s launched into\r\na familiar story, I have turned around to look at the faces of the\r\naudience, trying to understand what explains his enduring appeal.\r\nHumor is a big part of it. As a quick look at any of the hundreds\r\nof videos available on YouTube of his most popular speeches will\r\nreveal, Jack is very funny. Back in the early days, after he came\r\noffstage at an event we’d both spoken at, I joked to him that if his day\r\njob at Alibaba didn’t work out he had a promising career as a standup\r\ncomedian.4 Jack’s set pieces, his one-liners and anecdotes, and\r\nthe way he combines them are essentially the same as the “bits” that\r\ncomedians use to make up their routines.\r\nWith his tales of overcoming challenges and defying the odds,\r\nJack regularly drives some in his audience to tears, even hardened\r\nbusiness executives. After giving a talk to a group of students in\r\nSouth Korea, Jack himself appeared to be consumed by emotion\r\nwhen asked about his biggest regrets in life, replying that he regretted\r\nnot spending more time with his family. After composing himself, he\r\nadded, “Normally I make other people cry.”\r\nJack’s speeches, like that one in Seoul, reach a much wider\r\naudience than speeches by many public figures in China in part\r\nbecause he is able to deliver them in fluent English. Other tech\r\nexecutives in China speak English, too, many having been educated\r\noverseas, but Jack’s message has much greater resonance in both\r\nlanguages. Jack’s long-term business partner, Joe Tsai, told me:\r\n“Jack today is still one of the only international businesspeople who is\r\nas attention-grabbing in both English and Chinese.”\r\nTo build a connection to foreign audiences, Jack often peppers\r\nhis speeches with pop-culture references—including citing more\r\nrecent movies than Forrest Gump, some of which Alibaba is now\r\nfinancing. As his company expands its presence in Hollywood, Jack\r\nnow regularly enlists the support at his public appearances of famous\r\nactors like Daniel Craig, Kevin Spacey, and Tom Cruise, the star of\r\nParamount Pictures’ Mission: Impossible franchise—in 2015 Alibaba\r\ninvested in Rogue Nation, the franchise’s latest title. To audiences in\r\nChina, Jack often draws on stories from his favorite martial arts\r\nnovels, or Chinese revolutionary history. An American colleague once\r\nasked Jack about his references to Mao in his speeches in China.\r\nJack explained, “For me to motivate you I would talk about George\r\nWashington and the cherry tree.”\r\nJack’s Mantra\r\nPerhaps the most famous lesson of Jack the teacher is known by\r\nheart by every Alibaba employee: “Customers first, employees\r\nsecond, and shareholders third.” Jack describes this as Alibaba’s\r\nphilosophy.\r\nCustomers, especially the “shrimp,” come first in his mantra.\r\nWhen asked by the journalist Charlie Rose if he saw himself as an\r\n“apostle for small business,” Jack agreed, “I’m a strong believer. It’s\r\nmy religion.” Many small businesses in China don’t just use Alibaba’s\r\nwebsites as a marketing channel, they depend entirely on them to\r\nmake a living. Jack has always insisted on offering most of Alibaba’s\r\nservices for free.\r\nEmployees may come second to customers for Jack, but an\r\nability to motivate his team to overcome obstacles has been critical to\r\nAlibaba’s success. Joe Tsai didn’t hesitate in describing them to me\r\nas “disciples,” when recalling his first impression in 1999 of Alibaba’s\r\nearliest employees, some of whom had already followed Jack for\r\nyears. Jack doesn’t sugar coat the challenges to his employees. One\r\nof his favorite messages to them, and a “bit” in his comedy routine, is\r\n“Today is brutal, tomorrow is more brutal, but the day after tomorrow\r\nis beautiful. However, the majority of people will die tomorrow night.”\r\nThe goal for Alibaba to survive for 102 years might seem weird to\r\noutsiders but not to his employees, especially the Aliren (the “Ali\r\nPeople”)—those with more than three years of service—for whom it is\r\nan accepted part of the Alibaba culture.\r\nShareholders come third in Jack’s ranking because he refuses to\r\nbe diverted from his lofty ambitions by short-term pressures to\r\ngenerate profit. In public, Jack likes to make fun of his shareholders\r\nand investors, a means to burnish his credentials as a maverick with\r\nhis employees and the general public. When the share price of\r\nAlibaba’s first business, alibaba.com, languished on the stock market\r\nin 2009, Jack cried out at the rock concert–style gathering for the\r\ncompany’s employees, “Let the Wall Street investors curse us if they\r\nwish!” Not exactly standard behavior for the senior executive of a\r\npublicly listed company.\r\nYet despite the populist rhetoric, Jack has assiduously created\r\nopportunities at regular intervals—on average every four years or so\r\n—for employees and long-term shareholders to turn a profit from the\r\nsale of their shares. Investors who supported Alibaba early on and\r\nstuck with the company for years have been richly rewarded, much\r\nless so those public investors who purchased the company’s shares\r\nin their post-IPO peak.\r\nCompany Campus and Culture\r\nJack’s imprint can also be seen in the design of Alibaba’s 2.6-millionsquare-\r\nfoot Wetlands headquarters campus. From the main south\r\ngate visitors enter a massive complex of futuristic glass towers. At the\r\nbase of the office towers lie a large gym, Starbucks, and a countrystyle\r\nstore stocked with organic fruit and vegetables that could be\r\nstraight out of Silicon Valley. Farther to the north lies a huge, manmade\r\nlake. Dotted with lotuses and lily pads and bordered with reeds,\r\nthe lake is overlooked on one side by a cluster of elegant, whitewalled\r\nvillas topped with curved, black-tiled roofs, a scene\r\nreminiscent of Jack’s much-loved classical novels, like the sixteenthcentury\r\nwork The Water Margin.\r\nThe lake reflects Jack’s newfound passion for environmental\r\nprotection. When asked by President Obama in Manila what spurred\r\nhis interest in the environment, Jack told the story of a lake in which\r\nhe had last swam when he was twelve years old. “I went to swim in a\r\nlake and almost died in the lake because the water was so deep,\r\nmuch deeper than I thought. Five years ago I went to the lake, the\r\ntotal lake was dry.”\r\nOn a visit in the spring of 2015 to the campus, I had to step\r\ngingerly to avoid squashing the tiny baby frogs that had hopped out of\r\nthe man-made lake onto the walkway leading to the office towers. On\r\nmy way I also stopped by Alibaba’s large library and bookstore. Jack\r\nis a keen reader, particularly of titles by the Hong Kong–born martial\r\narts writer (Louis) Cha Leung-yung, known in China by his pen name\r\nJin Yong. His works are featured in the library along with classical\r\nworks and the latest books on management theory or Silicon Valley\r\nicons like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.\r\nBut beyond the design of the campus, it is in the culture of\r\nAlibaba that we can most clearly see the influence of its principal\r\nfounder. To zip around the Wetlands headquarters complex, Alibaba’s\r\nemployees make frequent use of the free bicycles the company\r\nprovides, a perk no doubt inspired by Google’s fleet, which is decked\r\nout in the U.S. giant’s signature blue, yellow, green, and red colors.\r\nThe bicycles at Alibaba are orange and include tandems: the two\r\nseats illustrating the company’s emphasis on teamwork above\r\nindividual achievement.\r\nA sense of subjugating one’s own needs for the interest of the\r\ncustomer is a cornerstone of Alibaba’s corporate culture. Just as\r\nDisney refers to all of its executives and employees as “cast\r\nmembers,” Alibaba places a big emphasis on camaraderie and a\r\ncommitment to the greater good.\r\nEvery May 10, around the time of the annual “Aliday,” a company\r\nanniversary that celebrates the spirit of teamwork shown by the\r\ncompany’s employees as they emerged from the spectre of the SARS\r\nvirus, Jack presides as chief witness over a ceremony to celebrate\r\nrecent weddings of company employees. Alibaba covers the lodging\r\nand meal expenses of the immediate family members who are invited\r\nto join. The photos of a hundred plus couples celebrating their\r\nmatrimonials together at one company has inevitably invited\r\ncomparisons to cults such as Rev. Sun Myung Moon’s Unification\r\nChurch. But Alibaba takes pains to point out that the event is just a\r\ncelebration, not a replacement, of the couples’ official marriage\r\nregistrations.\r\nA more tangible benefit for the couples and other Alibaba\r\nemployees is the interest-free loan of up to $50,000 offered to finance\r\nthe down payment on a new apartment, an increasingly valued perk\r\nfor staff members working in high-cost cities like Hangzhou and\r\nBeijing. Thousands of employees have taken advantage of the loans,\r\namounting to several hundred millions dollars today.\r\nAlibaba encourages a sense of informality at work. Every\r\nemployee is asked to adopt a nickname. The practice is so\r\nwidespread that it can invite confusion when they have to search to\r\nfind out the actual names of their colleagues to communicate to\r\npeople outside the company. Initially, the nicknames were drawn from\r\ncharacters in the novels of Jin Yong or other stories of martial arts\r\nand bygone eras. As Alibaba grew this pool of names was soon\r\nexhausted. Using their nicknames, employees post comments about\r\nthe company’s products or culture on Aliway, the company’s internal\r\nbulletin board. They can even initiate polls or invite the support of\r\ntheir colleagues to dispute assessments or management decisions,\r\nand address suggestions or complaints directly to Feng Qingyang.\r\nThat is the name of Jack’s online persona, a swordsman from one of\r\nhis favorite martial arts novels.\r\nEmployees are discouraged from ever complaining—a pet peeve\r\nof Jack’s—and encouraged instead to shoulder personal\r\nresponsibility, carrying out or delegating tasks rather than waiting for\r\norders from on high.\r\nMilitary terms crop up a lot at Alibaba. Top-performing individuals\r\nat Alibaba are known as King of Soldiers (bing wang). Fictional\r\ncharacter Xu Sanduo is sometimes used to illustrate management’s\r\nmessage. In the 2007 TV drama Soldier’s Sortie, Xu, a shy village\r\nboy, rises despite the odds to become an elite soldier in the People’s\r\nLiberation Army.\r\nSix Vein Spirit Sword\r\nAlibaba has codified its own company values in something it calls the\r\nSix Vein Spirit Sword. The term originates in the work of Jack’s\r\nfavorite novelist, Jin Yong. The sword he writes about is not an actual\r\nweapon, but the art of building up one’s own internal strengths in\r\norder to defeat any opponent. In Alibaba’s case, the strengths that\r\nform the Six Vein Spirit Sword are akin to those outlined in the\r\n“Mission, Vision, and Values” of Jack’s favorite corporate guru, Jack\r\nWelch, the former CEO of General Electric (GE).\r\nWelch’s 2005 book, Winning, recommends an almost messianic\r\nculture in the workplace: “Leaders make sure people not only see the\r\nvision, they live and breathe it.” Jack (Ma) has always held GE in high\r\nregard.\r\nThe “Six Veins” of Alibaba’s “Spirit Sword” are “customer first,\r\nteamwork, embrace change, integrity, passion, and commitment.”\r\nGeneric-sounding as they are, the company treats them very\r\nseriously. Commitment to the Six Vein Spirit Sword accounts for half\r\nof employee appraisals.\r\n“Customer first” is reflected in the power given to Taobao’s xiaoer\r\nreferees and in the composition of Alibaba’s workforce. Most of\r\nAlibaba employees work in sales, a much higher proportion than the\r\nmore technical bent of competitors like Tencent and Baidu. Face-toface\r\nvisits are a key part of Alibaba’s sales methods.5\r\n“Teamwork” at Alibaba means regular group games, songs, and\r\noutings. These can come as quite a culture shock to employees\r\njoining Alibaba from firms based in Silicon Valley. But for those fresh\r\nout of college, the system of apprentices and mentors is well\r\nreceived, including the routine of holding regular meetings to “kick off\r\nin the morning and share in the evening.” One former employee\r\nsummed it up: “Lots of companies focus only on results: You have to\r\ncomplete a certain number of orders. Alibaba takes the opposite\r\napproach: If you want to complete a certain number of orders this\r\nmonth, what do you need to do every day? By breaking it down into\r\nphases, each day could be dedicated to one key step in the process\r\n—and eventually you wouldn’t be far off from your goal.” Recognition\r\nof high performers in company-wide announcements helps, too, as\r\ndo the prizes awarded to the “A-teams” (lao A, a military reference),\r\nranging from Louis Vuitton wallets, belts, and limited-edition sneakers\r\nto monthly bonuses of tens of thousands of yuan or even a car.\r\nThe call to “embrace change” is reflected in Alibaba’s frequent\r\nrotation of its employees, switching them regularly between various\r\nnew products or between regions of the country, regardless of\r\nperformance. This creates lots of challenges, but Alibaba asks its\r\nemployees to “embrace setbacks,” a radical departure from traditional\r\nChinese culture, where failure is seen as something shameful.\r\nAlibaba’s approach is in line with the Silicon Valley practice of\r\nentrepreneurs celebrating previous failed ventures on their T-shirts, a\r\nrecognition that on the fast-moving battle lines of the China Internet,\r\nsome failure is unavoidable, or even desirable.\r\nThe “integrity” vein of the sword highlights the fact that corruption\r\nis a constant risk for Alibaba: Millions of merchants are constantly\r\nlooking for ways to promote their wares on Taobao, overseen by only\r\na few thousand xiaoer referees. The Communist Party of China\r\nregularly uses rotation of personnel to avoid alternative centers of\r\npower from developing, in an effort to keep corruption under control.\r\nDavid Wei, who served as the CEO of Alibaba.com, experienced\r\nJack’s penchant for rotation even before he had joined the company.\r\nIn the nine months between leaving his previous employer and joining\r\nAlibaba, David recalled, “[m]y job description and titles changed four\r\ntimes before I joined. First I was going to be head of Taobao, then\r\nhead of Alipay. I didn’t know what I was doing until one month before\r\nI was on board.” Once he finally joined as CEO of Alibaba’s B2B\r\nbusiness, David joked to Jack, “You changed my job so many times\r\nbefore I joined you couldn’t change it anymore.”\r\nWhatever the inspiration for regular rotation, Alibaba devolves a\r\nlot of autonomy to its business units, an effort to maintain a relatively\r\nflat management hierarchy and minimize the temptation to shame\r\nand blame.\r\nThe need to demonstrate “passion” when working for Alibaba\r\nwas summed up by one employee as “being a swordsman is all about\r\nbeing hot-blooded.” Compared to other firms, “people at Alibaba are\r\nmore passionate about their work, more honest, and more\r\nhardworking.” Jack’s emphasis on “commitment” is reflected in his\r\nfrequent invocation of the phrase to “work happily but live seriously.”\r\nThe whimsical approach he encourages at Alibaba is, he says, in\r\nstark contrast to most companies who emphasize “working seriously\r\nbut living happily.”\r\nMeasuring how employees live up to the Six Vein Spirit Sword is\r\nthe job of Alibaba’s human resources department, which plays a\r\ncritical role, overseeing the hiring of twelve thousand people in one\r\nyear alone. Relegated in some companies to a purely administrative\r\nfunction, HR at Alibaba has tremendous power over promotions and\r\nhiring. With its constant emphasis on culture and ideology, people at\r\nAlibaba refer to HR informally as the “Political Commissar” (zheng\r\nwei). The HR department also oversees extensive training, with\r\nmanuals of more than one thousand pages for new employees and a\r\nsophisticated database, matching performance closely with\r\npromotions and pay raises.\r\nThe culture of Alibaba endures even in the employees who have\r\nleft the company. Given the long history and rapid growth of the\r\ncompany, they number over twenty-five thousand. Many have banded\r\ntogether in a nonprofit organization called the Former Orange Club\r\n(qian cheng hui) to help its members share investment opportunities\r\nand career advice. One member, Hu Zhe, who left Alibaba in 2010\r\nafter working there for five years, described6 his reason for joining:\r\n“Former Alibaba employees are closely connected, as if there is a\r\nbond linking us together. The club serves as a very important platform\r\nfor us to communicate and exchange ideas.”\r\nA number of members7 have founded their own Internet\r\ncompanies or investment vehicles, some of which have established\r\nlinks with one another, active in a range of sectors including ecommerce,\r\nonline travel booking, Internet financial services, online\r\nmusic, online recruiting, O2O, venture capital, and health care. A\r\nsearch in a database8 of Chinese Internet-related start-ups reveals\r\nthat former Alibaba employees have been associated with 317 startups,\r\ncompared to 294 from Tencent and 223 from Baidu. While not all\r\nof these start-ups will be successful, indeed some of them have\r\nalready failed, the web of entrepreneurial activity is important both as\r\na source of future innovation and acquisition targets for Alibaba.\r\nA common thread in many of the ventures founded by Alibaba\r\nveterans is what some have described as a “Long March” culture, an\r\nambitious management ethos that involves personal sacrifice, and\r\nhuge investments of personnel and time. In contrast, in their new\r\nbusinesses, the veterans of Alibaba’s rivals such as Tencent are\r\nknown to focus more on reducing “time to market,” launching\r\nproducts that they can perfect later, an approach some refer to as\r\n“running with short steps.”\r\nAlibaba has been a team effort from the start. Jack doled out\r\nmuch more equity, and at an earlier stage, than many of his Internet\r\nfounder peers. But he has kept a firm control on the company through\r\nhis gift for communicating and his lofty ambitions. A modern-day Don\r\nQuixote, Jack relishes tilting at windmills, from retail to finance, to\r\nentertainment, health care, and beyond. To gain a sense of how likely\r\nAlibaba is to conquer these new horizons, let’s look at the events that\r\nmade Jack and the company what they are today.\r\nChapter Three\r\nFrom Student to Teacher\r\nIf you are one in a million in China, you’re one of 1,300 people.\r\n—Bill Gates\r\nBarrow Boy\r\nJack Ma was born on September 10, 1964, the Year of the Dragon, in\r\nHangzhou, a city one hundred miles to the southwest of Shanghai.\r\nHis parents named him “Yun,” meaning “cloud.” His surname, “Ma,” is\r\nthe same as the Chinese word for horse.\r\nJack’s mother, Cui Wencai, worked on a factory production line.\r\nHis father, Ma Laifa, worked as a photographer at the Hangzhou\r\nPhotography Agency. But both share a passion for pingtan, a form of\r\nChinese folk art performance that involves the singing of ballads and\r\ncomedic routines punctuated by the sound of wooden clappers.\r\nExposure to the art form may help explain Jack’s abilities as a\r\ncommunicator. Pingtan no doubt provided Jack’s parents a welcome\r\nescape from the hardscrabble life of postrevolutionary China, a\r\nwindow to a richer and more colorful past.\r\nA future icon of Chinese entrepreneurship, Jack came into the\r\nworld at a time when private enterprise had almost been completely\r\nextinguished. Ninety percent of industrial production had been taken\r\ninto the hands of the state. China was alone in the world, struggling to\r\nrecover from the Great Leap Forward. Faced with the starvation of\r\nmillions across the country, Mao Zedong had been forced to make a\r\n“self-criticism” and was relegated to the margins of power. Deng\r\nXiaoping was among those tasked with reversing the most damaging\r\naspects of collectivization, a foreshadowing of the pivotal role he\r\nwould play in unleashing the country’s economic miracle, which, two\r\ndecades later, would provide the opening for Jack’s entrepreneurial\r\ncareer.\r\nBut when Jack was two, Mao was back in power and China was\r\nsubjected to the ravages of the Cultural Revolution. Mao launched an\r\nattack on the “Four Olds”—old customs, culture, habits, and ideas—\r\nand Red Guards marched to destroy cultural sites and antiquities,\r\nincluding in Hangzhou, where they attacked and badly damaged the\r\ntomb of Yue Fei, a famous Song dynasty general. But even the Red\r\nGuards were not immune to the charms of the city, taking breaks from\r\ntheir violence with boat trips on West Lake. Mao himself developed a\r\nstrong attachment to Hangzhou, visiting it on more than forty\r\noccasions and staying up to seven months at a time. He enjoyed\r\nperformances of pingtan. Despite Mao’s fondness for the art form in\r\nprivate, old customs like pingtan became a target of the Red Guards\r\nand its practitioners were denounced. Jack’s family was at risk of\r\npersecution, particularly as his grandfather had been a local official1\r\nunder the Nationalist (KMT) government. During the Cultural\r\nRevolution Jack was taunted by his classmates, although fortunately\r\nthe family was not broken up like many were at the time.\r\nIn February 1972, President Nixon traveled to Hangzhou as part\r\nof his historic visit to China to meet Mao. Nixon was accompanied on\r\nthe trip by almost one hundred reporters, including Walter Cronkite,\r\nDan Rather, Ted Koppel, and Barbara Walters, their live broadcasts\r\ngenerating support for the normalization of relations with China,\r\nleading eventually to cities like Hangzhou reemerging as a\r\ndestination for foreign tourists.\r\nAs a boy, Jack fell in love with the English language and\r\nliterature, particularly readings of Mark Twain’s The Adventures of\r\nTom Sawyer that he listened to on a shortwave radio. Later it was the\r\narrival of foreign tourists in China that provided Jack with his opening\r\nto the outside world. In late 1978, when Jack was fourteen, China\r\nlaunched the new “open door” policy, initiated by Deng Xiaoping, in\r\npursuit of foreign trade and investment. After a decade of turmoil the\r\ncountry was on the verge of bankruptcy, and desperately needed\r\nhard currency.\r\nIn 1978, only 728 foreign tourists visited Hangzhou. But the\r\nfollowing year more than forty thousand came to the city. Jack\r\nrelished any opportunity to practice his English. He started waking up\r\nbefore dawn and riding his bicycle for forty minutes to the Hangzhou\r\nHotel to greet foreign tourists. As he recalled, “Every morning from\r\nfive o’clock I would read English in front of the hotel. A lot of foreign\r\nvisitors came from the USA, from Europe. I’d give them a free tour of\r\nWest Lake, and they taught me English. For nine years! And I\r\npracticed my English every morning, no matter if it snowed or rained.”\r\nAn American tourist whose father and husband were named\r\nJack suggested the name and Ma Yun became known in English\r\nhenceforth as Jack. He is dismissive of the quality of his English: “I\r\njust make myself understood. The grammar is terrible.” But Jack\r\nnever dismisses how much learning the language has helped him in\r\nlife: “English helps me a lot. It makes me understand the world better,\r\nhelps me to meet the best CEOs and leaders in the world, and makes\r\nme understand the distance between China and the world.”\r\nAmong the many tourists who came to Hangzhou in 1980 was an\r\nAustralian family, the Morleys. Ken Morley, a recently retired electrical\r\nengineer, had signed up for a tour of China offered by the local\r\nbranch of the Australia China Friendship Society. He took along his\r\nwife, Judy, and their three children, David, Stephen, and Susan, for\r\nwhom it would be their first overseas trip. For Jack, their visit would\r\nchange his life.\r\nToday, David runs a yoga studio in Australia, where I managed to\r\ntrack him down. He kindly shared his memories and the photos of his\r\nfamily’s visit to China and their enduring friendship with Jack.\r\nOn July 1, 1980, the Morleys’ Australian tour group arrived by\r\nplane in Hangzhou from Beijing and was transferred by bus to the\r\nShangri-La Hotel on West Lake, the same hotel (then the Hangzhou\r\nHotel) where President Nixon and his entourage had stayed eight\r\nyears earlier. David recalls being shown the suite where the First\r\nCouple had stayed, allocated to their tour leader, complete with\r\n“plush, red velvet toilet seats, which we three children were\r\nfascinated by.”\r\nThe next day the Australian group’s itinerary included a boat trip\r\non West Lake, followed by a visit to the nearby tea plantations and on\r\nto the Liuhe (Six Harmonies) Pagoda before returning to the hotel for\r\ndinner at 6:30 P.M. Taking advantage of the “free evening,” David and\r\na young woman called Keva whom he had befriended on the trip\r\nsnuck across the road from the hotel to the park opposite,\r\noverlooking West Lake. There they proceeded to play with matches,\r\npracticing the art of “match flicking” that she had taught him. This\r\ninvolved standing a match upside-down with its head on the striking\r\nsurface and flicking it with your fingers and watching it spiral off to,\r\nDavid recalls, “hopefully an uneventful extinguishment.” Fortunately\r\nthat day, the park didn’t catch fire. But David and Keva’s antics did\r\ncatch the attention of a fifteen-year-old boy—Jack Ma.\r\nDavid recalls, “It was on that free evening, flicking matches in the\r\npark, that I was approached by a young man wanting to try his newly\r\nacquired English skills on me. He introduced himself; we swapped\r\npleasantries and agreed to meet in the park again.”\r\nOn July 4, their last day in Hangzhou, David introduced Jack to\r\nhis sister, Susan, and invited him and some other local children to\r\nplay Frisbee with them in the park. David described the scene to me:\r\nMarking out a playing area with shoes and other items “we were soon\r\nsurrounded by hundreds of Chinese spectators.” Jack’s father, Ma\r\nLaifa, took photos of the game.\r\nDavid’s father, Ken Morley, once described his first impressions\r\nof Jack as a “barrow boy,” or a street hawker. “He really wanted to\r\npractice his English, and he was very friendly. Our kids were very\r\nimpressed.”\r\nDavid described how the family stayed in touch: “What followed\r\nthat meeting was a pen pal relationship that I kept up for a few years\r\nuntil my father started to take an interest in helping this young man.”\r\nJack would correspond regularly with Ken, referring to him as “Dad,”\r\nwho asked him to “double space his letters so that any corrections\r\ncould be sent back in the spaces.” David explained, “The original with\r\ncorrections was returned for learning purposes with the reply letter. I\r\nbelieve this greatly helped and encouraged Jack to continue with his\r\nEnglish studies.”\r\nJack Ma, age fifteen, with his new Australian friend David Morley by West Lake. David is\r\nwearing his Australia China Friendship Society ID card. The Morley Family\r\nArmed with his improving English, rich knowledge of the history\r\nof the area, and a knack for storytelling, Jack embraced the\r\nopportunity to show more foreign tourists around the sights of West\r\nLake. He relished visiting Hangzhou’s teahouses, where locals would\r\nplay Chinese chess and cards and recount “tall tales.”\r\nJack would often accompany his grandmother to Buddhist\r\ntemples to burn incense and worship the gods. He developed a\r\npassion for tai chi and reading The Water Margin, a classic Chinese\r\ntale that features 108 heroes—the number of employees he later\r\nwould set as an early head count target for Alibaba.\r\nBut by far his favorite works are those of Hong Kong author\r\nLouis Cha, who writes under the pen name Jin Yong. Born in\r\nZhejiang Province in 1924, Jin Yong cofounded in 1959 the Hong\r\nKong newspaper Ming Pao, which published many of his early works.\r\nIn total, he authored fifteen novels, all in the wuxia genre, which\r\nblends historical and fictional tales of martial arts and chivalry. Jin\r\nYong is highly popular in the Chinese-speaking world. Worldwide\r\nsales of his books have topped 100 million copies. There have been\r\nmore than ninety television series and film adaptations of his work.\r\nOne of Jack’s childhood pen pal letters to David Morley. The Morley family\r\nSet between the sixth century BC and the eighteenth century, Jin\r\nYong’s works contain strong elements of Chinese patriotism, pitting\r\nheroic peoples against northern invaders such as the Mongols and\r\nManchus.\r\nYi Zhongtian, a well-known writer and a professor at Xiamen\r\nUniversity, summarized the popular appeal of traditional stories and\r\nmartial arts as follows: “In traditional Chinese society, people have\r\nthree dreams. The first is a wise emperor. People hope to have a\r\ngood leader so that they can have peace in the country. The second\r\ndream is clean officials. If there are no clean officials, then comes the\r\nthird dream, chivalrous heroes. People hope that the heroes could\r\nstand for them, kill the greedy officials, and bring justice back to the\r\nsociety. However, if there are no heroes, people can only seek\r\ncomfort from martial arts fiction. That’s why many Chinese people like\r\nkung fu novels.”\r\nJin Yong’s writing is suffused with traditional elements of Chinese\r\nculture and arts, as well as Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism.\r\nJack found inspiration in Jin Yong’s legendary warrior Feng\r\nQingyang. Feng was a teacher. His martial arts moves were never\r\nperformed to any set plan.\r\nIn his own practice of martial arts, Jack was trained in tai chi2 by\r\na woman in her seventies who, according to Chen Wei—a former\r\nstudent of Jack’s who is now his personal assistant—was so skilled\r\nthat she could defend herself against two or three younger men.\r\nEvery morning she would close her eyes to meditate before practicing\r\ntai chi, “listening to the sound of flowers blooming.” Today Jack often\r\ntravels with a personal tai chi coach.\r\nBut these skills were of little use against one of Jack’s earliest\r\nfoes: math. In China, all high school students hoping to go on to\r\nhigher education have to pass a merit-based national higher\r\neducation entrance exam, commonly known as the gaokao, literally\r\nthe “high test.” The gaokao takes place over two or three days. Math,\r\nalong with Chinese and a foreign language, is mandatory.\r\nThe gaokao is widely seen as one of the most challenging in the\r\nworld, requiring a huge amount of preparation and memorization.\r\nToday there is growing criticism of the exam’s negative social\r\nconsequences, including depression and suicide.\r\nJack took the gaokao but failed badly, scoring 1/120 in math. His\r\nhopes crushed, he took to menial labor delivering heavy bundles of\r\nmagazines from printers to the Hangzhou train station on a pedicab,\r\na job Jack managed to land thanks only to his father’s connections.\r\nJack was rejected from numerous other jobs, including as a waiter in\r\na hotel. He was told he was not tall enough.\r\nChen Wei relates in his biography of Jack, This Is Still Ma Yun,\r\nhow his boss found inspiration in the book Life, written by the\r\nChinese author Lu Yao. Published in 1982, and made into a film in\r\n1984, the book relates the story of Gao Jialin. A talented man living in\r\na village, Gao struggles but ultimately fails to escape the clutches of\r\npoverty. Jack resolved to have a different fate, and took the gaokao\r\nagain. This time his math score improved slightly, to 19/120, but his\r\noverall score dropped considerably.\r\nJack once again set about applying for jobs to make ends meet.\r\nHe sent out eleven job applications but all met with rejection. Jack\r\nlikes to tell the story of how even KFC turned him away, the only one\r\nof twenty-four candidates they didn’t like.\r\nUndeterred, Jack became a regular every Sunday at the library\r\nof Zhejiang University, where he committed to memory the formulas\r\nand equations he would have to master to pass the test.\r\nJack never gained admission to a prestigious university in Beijing\r\nor Shanghai. But in 1984, when he was nineteen, he raised his math\r\nscore sufficiently to win acceptance to a local university, the\r\nHangzhou Teachers College. On his third attempt at the gaokao he\r\nscored 89 in math. His score was several points below the normal\r\nacceptance rate at other universities for a full four-year\r\nundergraduate degree.3 Normally he would have been relegated to a\r\ntwo- to three-year associate’s degree course,4 but Hangzhou\r\nTeachers College had a few spaces left for male students, and Jack\r\nsqueaked in. The college was not a prestigious one. Jack recalled\r\nthat “it was considered the third or fourth class of my city.” In his\r\npublic appearances, Jack often speaks of his twice failing the gaokao\r\nas a badge of honor.\r\nTeacher\r\nIn his sophomore year, Jack was elected president of the school’s\r\nstudent union, where he launched a Top Ten Campus Singers\r\nCompetition, and was later president of the Hangzhou Students\r\nFederation.\r\nIn 1985, Jack also received an invitation from Ken Morley to stay\r\nwith his family at their home in New Lambton, Australia, a suburb of\r\nNewcastle in New South Wales. It was the first time Jack had left\r\nChina. He stayed for a month and returned a changed man.\r\n“Everything I’d learned in China was that China was the richest\r\ncountry in the world,” Jack later said. “When I arrived in Australia, I\r\nrealized it was totally different. I started to think you have to use your\r\nown mind to judge, to think.”\r\nJack has never shown any hint of shyness toward foreigners.\r\nDuring his trip to Australia, Jack gave a demonstration to a local tai\r\nchi group gathered in a suburban hall, showing off his skills at\r\nmonkey- and drunken-style kung fu. “I’d often request he do his\r\ndrunken boxing routine, it was great to watch,” Stephen Morley\r\nrecalls.\r\nStephen Morley, Jack, and Anne Lee, a cousin of the Morleys. Louis and Anne Lee\r\nJack’s friendship with the Morleys blossomed. After Jack’s trip to\r\nAustralia, Ken Morley made a return visit to Hangzhou with Stephen.\r\nAs the Ma family home was too small to host guests, Jack arranged\r\naccommodation at a student college for the Morleys. “We would have\r\ndinner at the Ma household and cycle to the college after dinner,”\r\nStephen recalls. “Jack would always help prepare and cook dinner,\r\nalways making us feel special.”\r\nLouis and Anne Lee\r\nDuring their holiday, Jack planned a trip out to the countryside for\r\nhis two Australian friends, and they got their fair share of Chinese\r\nadventures. For transportation, Jack secured the use of a pickup\r\ntruck. He and the driver sat up front in the cab while Ken and Stephen\r\nsat on two loose chairs that Jack had placed on the open-top cargo\r\nbed. On their way out of Hangzhou one day, the driver had to break\r\nsuddenly to avoid a cyclist who had fallen off his bike, sending Ken\r\nand Stephen hurtling forward into the rear of the cab. Fortunately they\r\nescaped injury. Back in town later that evening, Jack arranged a\r\nbanquet for his Australian friends with some local officials and VIPs,\r\nlooking out over a street below where a festival was taking place.\r\nStephen recalls, “I’d never seen so many people congested in one\r\nplace. It became clear then that Jack was a bit of a networker,\r\norganizing a vehicle and a dinner with the mayor required\r\nconnections.”\r\nBack in Hangzhou, Jack’s university life was not carefree. Money\r\nconcerns were pressing. Once again Ken Morley stepped in to help.\r\nWhile the tuition at the college was free, the compulsory live-in fees\r\nwere beyond the means of Jack’s family. “When we came back to\r\nAustralia we thought about it,” Morley recalled, “and decided we could\r\nhelp. It was not much—five to ten dollars a week, I think—so I would\r\nsend him a check every six months.”\r\nAt Hangzhou Teachers College, Jack met and fell in love with\r\nZhang Ying, a fellow student and Zhejiang-native who had taken\r\nCathy as her first name. The relationship was kept secret from Jack’s\r\nfamily. During a dinner one evening in Hangzhou with his father, Jack,\r\nand his parents, Stephen Morley recalled, “I blurted out ‘nü peng you’\r\n[girlfriend] and gestured towards Jack. Jack looked mortified and\r\nprobably wanted to kill me at this point. This led to a discussion in\r\nMandarin between Jack and his parents. Jack still reminds me of the\r\ntime I blabbed on him as a kid.”\r\nMa Yin (Jack’s sister), Stephen Morley, Ken Morley, and Jack in Hangzhou. The Morley\r\nfamily\r\nJack inside the kitchen of the new apartment that Ken Morley helped him purchase in\r\nHangzhou. The Morley Family\r\nDespite being outed by their young Australian friend, the\r\nrelationship between Jack and Cathy endured and they were married\r\nsoon after. The Morleys once again showed their generosity and gave\r\nthe couple 22,000 Australian dollars (about $18,000) to help finance\r\nthe purchase of their first home, two apartments on top of a tower\r\nblock that they combined together to make a penthouse.\r\nJack later said that words could not express what Ken and Judy\r\nMorley had done for him.\r\nKen Morley died in September 2004 at the age of seventy-eight.\r\nHis obituary in a local newspaper records that he had taken “his\r\nchildren to China and Cuba and encouraged them to get an\r\neducation, travel and have a political point of view. This broadminded,\r\ngenerous approach extended outside the family and Ken is\r\nwell-known for befriending a poor young Chinese boy. This boy is\r\nnow a man who heads a successful company in China.” At the\r\nfuneral, a clergyman read out a message from Jack to the Morley\r\nfamily in which he disclosed a plan he had to one day travel the\r\nTrans-Siberian Railway with Ken, whom he described as his\r\n“Australian ‘Dad’ and mentor.” His son David wrote to me, “It may be\r\na fantasy now, and with his celebrity status something difficult to\r\nachieve for Jack incognito, but I would like one day to fulfill the idea of\r\nthat trip on behalf of my father.”\r\nJack and a fellow lecturer prepare to host a talk by Jack’s mentor, Ken Morley, in April 1991\r\nat the Hangzhou YMCA. The Morley Family\r\nThe irony is that Ken Morley, who was instrumental in unlocking\r\nopportunities for a man who would become one of China’s richest\r\ncapitalists, was himself a committed socialist. Born the son of a miner\r\nand a seamstress, he was a longtime political activist and member of\r\nthe Communist Party of Australia, presenting himself as a candidate\r\nin local elections for the Socialist Alliance. In the years before he\r\ndied, he would witness some of Jack’s early success, expressing his\r\nembarrassment at the money and gifts Jack and Cathy liked to\r\nshower on him. Instead he treasured most, he said, the honor that\r\nJack and Cathy bestowed on him by naming their eldest child after\r\nhim (calling him “Kun,” an approximation of Ken). China impacted the\r\nMorleys, too: Susan Morley went on to study Chinese in Sydney for\r\nseveral years. The Ma and Morley families remain close friends to\r\nthis day and continue to vacation together.\r\nJack and Ken Morley sharing some beer. The Morley Family\r\nTo Get Rich Is Glorious\r\nIn 1992, Deng Xiaoping undertook his famous “southern tour,”\r\nimmortalized5 in his pronouncement that “to get rich is glorious.” For\r\nthe country’s entrepreneurs, relegated to the margins of society,\r\nDeng’s endorsement was an unambiguous invitation to return to the\r\nfold.\r\nBut Jack was not yet an entrepreneur. Upon graduating in 1988,\r\nwith a bachelor’s degree in English, he had become a lecturer in\r\nEnglish and international trade at the Hangzhou Institute of Electronic\r\nEngineering. While his fellow students were all assigned to teach\r\nEnglish in middle schools, Jack was the only one among five hundred\r\ngraduates to be assigned to teach in an institution of higher learning.\r\nBut he had started to think of a future beyond teaching. Jack recalled\r\nthe lesson he drew from Deng’s southern tour: “You can be rich; you\r\ncan help other people be rich.” Although he was keen to serve out the\r\nremaining two years of his contract, Jack began to pursue\r\nopportunities outside his school.\r\nAfter his day job at the institute, he started teaching English\r\nclasses at the Hangzhou YMCA. According to Chen Wei, who first\r\nattended a class in 1992, Jack’s English classes were popular\r\nbecause he spent little time teaching grammar, vocabulary, or reading\r\nout texts. Instead Jack preferred to pick a topic and engage in\r\nconversation. His students came from a wide variety of backgrounds,\r\nfrom high schoolers striving to study overseas, to college students, to\r\nfactory workers and young professionals. Jack would often spend\r\ntime with them after class, “drinking tea, playing cards, and chatting.”\r\nHangzhou had a regular “English corner,” a gathering of local\r\nresidents keen to practice their language skills on one another, which\r\nmet every Sunday morning in the Six Park beside West Lake. Jack\r\nwould take along his students from night school, but as they were\r\neager to go more often, he decided to launch his own English corner.\r\nHis sessions were held every Wednesday night, with Jack finding that\r\nthe anonymity that darkness conferred made his students less selfconscious\r\nin practicing their imperfect English.\r\nBut Jack’s teaching days were coming to an end. Swept up in the\r\nenthusiasm that Deng Xiaoping’s southern tour had fanned, he\r\nresolved to launch his own business before he turned thirty. Working\r\npart-time on his new business, after class, he named his first\r\ncompany “Hope.”\r\nChapter Four\r\nHope and Coming to America\r\nChina has a million companies that want to sell abroad, but they don’t\r\nknow how.\r\n—Jack Ma\r\nIn January 1994, at the age of twenty-nine, Jack founded the\r\nHangzhou Haibo Translation Agency. When the company first started\r\nthere were only five staff members, mostly retired teachers from the\r\ninstitute. He rented two rooms at 27 Qingnian Road, not far from\r\nWest Lake in a converted church that once housed the YMCA. Today\r\nthe sign for Hope Translation still hangs outside, where the translation\r\nagency maintains a meeting room, adjacent to what has become the\r\nYMCA International Youth Hostel.\r\nJack convinced some students from his English night school to\r\nlend a hand with the business, largely to help find his first clients. On\r\nopening day, his students went to Wulin Square with banners to help\r\npublicize the company.\r\nA few of these students ended up joining the company full-time.\r\nOne of the early employees was Zhang Hong. She met Jack in 1993,\r\nwhen he was teaching advanced oral English at the YMCA. She\r\nrecalled, “Nobody else saw the opportunity in this business. . . . We\r\ndidn’t make much money at first, but [Jack] persevered. . . . I respect\r\nhim tremendously for he has a great ability to motivate people and he\r\ncan invest things that seem hopeless with exciting possibility. He can\r\nmake those around him get excited about life.”\r\nJack’s first business was focused on helping local companies\r\nfind customers overseas. Jack later recalled, “I had to teach during\r\nthe day, and had no time to help others do translation work. But lots\r\nof retired teachers had nothing to do at home, and their pension was\r\nlow, so I wanted to found a translation company, to be an\r\nintermediary.” With its narrow focus on translation, Jack would not\r\nfind commercial success with Hope. But his first venture gave him\r\ndirect exposure to the entrepreneurial revolution that was\r\ntransforming Zhejiang and his first tentative steps as an entrepreneur\r\nhimself.\r\nThe Chinese word for Hope was Haibo, which literally translates\r\nas “vast like the sea.” Popular slang for leaving a government job and\r\nentering the private sector at the time was to xia hai, or to “jump into\r\nthe sea.”\r\nJack wanted to get his feet wet as an entrepreneur, but he wasn’t\r\nquite ready to take the plunge and abandon his public sector job as a\r\nteacher. Entrepreneurship is such a well-established part of modern\r\nChinese business and culture today that it is easy to forget how much\r\nthings have changed in the last few decades.\r\nIn the earliest days of China’s economic reforms,\r\nentrepreneurship was viewed as a highly risky, even illegal\r\nundertaking. Memories then were fresh of those imprisoned or even\r\nexecuted during the Cultural Revolution for carrying out commercial\r\nactivities.\r\nFrom 1978, the establishment of a “household contract\r\nresponsibility system” allowed farmers to sell surplus crops on the\r\nopen market. The first embers of private business started to grow\r\nwith the township and village enterprises (TVEs). The TVEs were\r\nnominally state-controlled but in effect privately run rural enterprises.\r\nThe spark was lit for a rapid expansion of private sector employment\r\nin China.\r\nFrom the early 1980s, the Chinese government began to\r\nrecognize entrepreneurs,1 first individual entrepreneurs then\r\nbusinesses run by entrepreneurs.\r\nThe first entrepreneurs, the getihu, were not leaving behind a\r\nstable government job, but rather were those with nothing to lose.\r\nThey were mostly agricultural laborers, their low status inviting the\r\npejorative association of “peddlers.” As they grew richer they were\r\nresented and mocked for their success and lack of class. One early\r\ngetihu even papered the walls of his home with banknotes.\r\nSome of the richest businesspeople in China today started out as\r\nlowly getihu, many in Zhejiang Province. To understand Alibaba’s\r\nrise, it is helpful to understand how Jack’s home province became the\r\nsource of so much wealth.\r\nZhejiang: China’s Crucible of Entrepreneurship\r\nHangzhou, the nearby port of Ningbo, and other industrial clusters\r\ndotting northern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu Provinces form the\r\neconomic powerhouse of the Yangtze River delta, with Shanghai as\r\nits center.\r\nHome to Alibaba’s e-commerce empire, Hangzhou has a long\r\ntradition as a trading center. The city once served as the\r\nsouthernmost point of the 1,100-mile-long Grand Canal, whose full\r\nname in Chinese is Jing Hang Da Yun He, or the Beijing-Hangzhou\r\nGrand Canal. For more than a thousand years, the Grand Canal was\r\nthe main trading artery between south and north China, making\r\nHangzhou one of the most prosperous cities in China.2\r\nHangzhou and the nearby port of Ningbo lie on relatively flat\r\nland. But much of Zhejiang Province is mountainous, its elevations\r\nand rivers creating a patchwork of isolated communities and dialects.\r\nThe need to trade and the distance from the country’s political rulers\r\nhave helped make Zhejiang the cradle of private enterprise in China.\r\nToday many of the province’s entrepreneurs sit atop China’s rich list.\r\nMost, like Jack, started out living hardscrabble lives.\r\nZong Qinghou, worth more than $11 billion, is the founder of\r\nWahaha, China’s largest beverage manufacturer. From the age of\r\nfour, Zong grew up in Hangzhou, later working on a salt farm on an\r\nisland off the coast of Ningbo before graduating from secondary\r\nschool. In the 1980s he sold ice pops on the street for less than a\r\npenny. Li Shufu, worth more than $2 billion, founded Geely, China’s\r\nfirst non-state-owned car manufacturer. He started out assembling\r\nrefrigerators using spare parts, then in 1988 founded Geely. In 2010\r\nGeely purchased Sweden’s Volvo Cars. Lu Guanqiu, worth more than\r\n$7 billion, is the founder of Wanxiang Group, the Hangzhou-based\r\nauto parts manufacturer. He started out as a farmer, then started\r\nbuying scrap metal from villagers.\r\nJack’s friend Guo Guangchang, a man worth an estimated $7\r\nbillion before his unexplained disappearance for several days in\r\nDecember 2015, is the founder of investment firm Fosun. Guo\r\nsurvived the Cultural Revolution only by eating moldy, dried\r\nvegetables, later winning entry to Shanghai’s prestigious Fudan\r\nUniversity, where he sold bread door-to-door in the dorms to make\r\nends meet. Prior to his surprise absence in 2015, Fosun had been\r\ndescribed by the Financial Times as the “Berkshire Hathaway of\r\nChina.” Guo is an active supporter of Alibaba’s forays into logistics\r\nand finance.\r\nAs we saw in the logistics edge of the iron triangle, one cluster of\r\nZhejiang entrepreneurs has played an important role in Alibaba’s\r\nsuccess. The Tonglu Gang of logistics companies, located in the town\r\nof Tonglu to the southwest of Hangzhou, account for more than half of\r\nall package deliveries in China. Tonglu was the birthplace of the late\r\nNie Tengfei, founder of courier giant Shentong (STO Express). Born\r\ninto poverty, Nie raised pigs, planted grain, and sold firewood before\r\nmoving to Hangzhou to work in a printing factory. He moonlighted as\r\na courier delivering bread on his tricycle before spotting an\r\nopportunity at the age of twenty to beat China Post,3 delivering\r\ncustoms forms for trading companies in Hangzhou to the port in\r\nShanghai. Nie died in a car crash in 1998, but Shentong continued to\r\nthrive. Two of Nie’s relatives and one of his classmates each founded\r\nthree other large courier companies in the Tonglu Gang.4\r\nHangzhou, the provincial capital, and Ningbo, its largest port,\r\nhave long been prosperous trading centers. But two other cities in\r\nZhejiang, Wenzhou and Yiwu, though less well known overseas are\r\nrenowned in China for their newfound wealth. Wenzhou helped\r\nlegitimize the role of entrepreneurs in society, and Yiwu established\r\nthe wholesale markets that extended their reach to all parts of the\r\ncountry and indeed the world. Wenzhou and Yiwu have played as\r\nimportant a part in China’s entrepreneurial revolution as the cotton\r\nmills of Lancashire did in Britain’s industrial revolution.\r\nWenzhou and Yiwu provided the dynamism that inspired Jack to\r\nlaunch his own entrepreneurial career. Innovations in Wenzhou\r\nopened the door for Alibaba’s future forays into financial services,\r\nand the massive wholesale market in Yiwu was a template for\r\nAlibaba’s first business model, connecting merchants in China with\r\nglobal buyers. Let us take a brief tour.\r\nWenzhou\r\nWenzhou lies two hundred miles southeast of Hangzhou. Hemmed in\r\nby mountains on one side and the East China Sea on the other,\r\nWenzhou had always looked to trade, including tea exports, for its\r\nlivelihood. But after 1949, its proximity to nationalist Taiwan became a\r\nliability. With Shanghai a three-hundred-mile ferry ride away, the city\r\nsuffered from its isolation.\r\nWenzhou had little arable land and many unemployed or\r\nunderemployed agricultural workers. But once Deng Xiaoping\r\nlaunched his economic reforms in 1978, the private sector started to\r\nboom. Wenzhou’s entrepreneurs, often working with family members,\r\nstarted out in light manufacturing. In the 1980s they were some of the\r\nfirst merchants to fan out across China to sell their wares, including\r\nknockoffs of Western brands. For many, Chinese goods from\r\nWenzhou were the first items they ever purchased that were not\r\nmade by the state.\r\nWenzhou has played a pivotal role in legitimizing\r\nentrepreneurship in China. In 1984 the Wenzhou municipal\r\ngovernment invited the city’s most successful private entrepreneurs to\r\na conference. Although the government wanted to help them\r\nshowcase their success, many entrepreneurs refused to attend,\r\nfearing arrest. Only two years earlier a number of entrepreneurs in\r\nthe city had been arrested for speculation. They still languished in\r\nprison. Of the entrepreneurs who showed up for the meeting with the\r\ngovernment a number brought along their toothbrushes, in case they\r\ntoo were detained. But the entrepreneurs were not jailed. After\r\nreleasing those arrested two years earlier, the Wenzhou government\r\npublished an unprecedented admission in local newspapers that it\r\nhad erred. Professor Yasheng Huang at the Massachusetts Institute\r\nof Technology writes that “many entrepreneurs cited these two\r\nepisodes as having convinced them of their personal security.”\r\nFor decades in China, the country’s state-owned banks ignored\r\nprivate enterprises and individuals, making politically directed loans5\r\nto the state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\r\nStarved for lending, the private sector in Wenzhou began to\r\ndevise its own private credit market, often adopting illegal structures.\r\nThe local government actively supported the establishment of private\r\ncredit associations, cooperatives, and money houses—a form of local\r\nfinancial broker that derives profits from the spread between rates of\r\ninterest on deposits and loans—forming a system that came to be\r\nknown as the “Wenzhou model.” Wenzhou paved the way for\r\nAlibaba’s own foray into banking. When Alibaba received its banking\r\nlicense in 2014, two of the other five recipients were from Wenzhou.\r\nRaw entrepreneurial spirit, plus access to capital, fueled an\r\nexplosion in the city’s private sector, which so dominated Wenzhou’s\r\neconomy that the state became completely marginalized. Facing a\r\nhuge demand for new roads and bridges, the entrepreneurs of\r\nWenzhou didn’t wait for funds or instructions from Beijing. They\r\nsimply built their own, in a surge of construction that bordered on\r\nanarchy, lacking any coordinated plan.\r\nIn 1990, acting on their own, entrepreneurs even funded the\r\nconstruction of the city’s airport. One year later the country’s first\r\nprivate carrier, Juneyao Airlines, was launched in the city. In 1998,\r\nWenzhou created China’s first privately funded railroad.\r\nToday in China, Wenzhou is synonymous with wealth. The city’s\r\nresidents are resented by some for their mass shopping sprees,\r\nalways paying cash, which have driven up the prices of apartments in\r\nBeijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, New York City, and beyond.\r\nYiwu\r\nYiwu is an unlikely location for one of the world’s key trading nodes. It\r\nis located inland, far from Hangzhou, Ningbo, or the East China Sea.\r\nLike Wenzhou, it was dirt poor, with little cultivable land. Lacking any\r\nalternative, local farmers since the sixteenth century turned to trade.\r\nTheir main product was brown sugar, which they cooked with ginger\r\nand cut into chunks. This they bartered for chicken feathers, which\r\nthey used to make feather dusters or mulched to make fertilizer.\r\nIn the winters, when the farmers had little to do and food was\r\nscarce, local men would hoist a pole with bamboo baskets on their\r\nshoulders and travel the country as peddlers. They carried out sugar\r\nchunks, sewing needles, and thread, and brought chicken feathers\r\nback to Yiwu. As they walked they would use a rattle drum to attract\r\ncustomers. They became known as “Sugar Shoulder-Pole Men”—a\r\nprecursor to today’s million-strong courier workforce.\r\nSoon there were so many itinerant merchants in Yiwu that they\r\nformed a veritable mobile army. To supply them with wares in the\r\n1700s, the first wholesale markets started to appear in the city. Trade\r\nflourished for centuries until the dislocation of the Japanese invasion\r\nand the communist revolution.\r\nWhen Deng Xiaoping’s reforms started to take effect, the\r\nwholesale trade came out of the shadows. In September 1982,\r\ntraders in Yiwu were allowed access to a patch of land—a ditch that\r\nthey had first cemented over—to set up their stalls. Seven hundred\r\nstalls popped up almost immediately and Yiwu became one of the\r\nfirst wholesale markets of its kind in postrevolutionary China.\r\nToday the city is home to the largest wholesale market in the\r\nworld and its population has shot up to over two million people. An\r\nestimated 40,000 people visit the wholesale market every day. The\r\n700 stalls have become 70,000 outlets, housed today inside the Yiwu\r\nInternational Trade Center. This colossal building spans more than 40\r\nmillion square feet, generating a turnover of more than $6 billion per\r\nyear.\r\nOn sale inside are an estimated 1.7 million products, from toys to\r\nplastic flowers, jewelry to suitcases, clothing to home appliances,\r\nanything and everything that is Made in China. Without knowing it, a\r\nhuge amount of what we consume in the West has passed through\r\nYiwu. Even Christmas is “Made in Yiwu”: More than 60 percent of the\r\nworld’s Christmas decorations are manufactured in the city. Although\r\ntraders travel there overwhelmingly for its cheap prices, part of Yiwu’s\r\nattraction has been its supply of counterfeit products, for example\r\nhandbags sold under almost-familiar-sounding names such as\r\n“Gussi.” The Financial Times journalist James Kynge traveled to the\r\ncity in 2005 to research the problem of fake goods, only to find out\r\nthat even hotels there were fake: He passed by not the Hyatt but the\r\n“Hiyat.”\r\nYiwu attracts traders from all four corners of the world. The town\r\nis a favorite of traders from the Middle East, making Yiwu home to the\r\nfastest-growing Muslim community in China. With an estimated\r\n35,000 Muslims in the city at any time—Chinese, South Asian, and\r\nArab—Yiwu features dozens of Muslim restaurants and an ornate $4\r\nmillion mosque featuring marble imported from Iran.\r\nSince 2014, Yiwu is the start of the longest freight railroad line in\r\nthe world. Taking twenty-one days to traverse end to end, the 8,111-\r\nmile line links Yiwu with Madrid.\r\nWhat makes Yiwu such an essential node is its role marketing\r\nthe goods of the countless industrial clusters of Zhejiang and other\r\nparts of the Yangtze River delta. These single-product towns can\r\nrepresent 80 percent or more of the production of individual\r\ncommodities—not just in China but worldwide. Shaoxing is “textile\r\ncity” and Yongkang is “hardware city,” churning out 30,000 steel doors\r\nand 150,000 motor scooters every day. Taizhou is known as “sewing\r\nmachine city” and Shenzhou as “necktie city.” Haining calls itself\r\n“leather city.” There is even a “toothbrush city”—in case nervous\r\nentrepreneurs get a summons from their local government official—in\r\nHangji.\r\nYiwu itself claims to be China’s “sock city,” producing annually\r\nmore than three billion pairs of socks for companies like Walmart and\r\nDisney, although Datang, near Hangzhou, also claims to be “sock\r\ncity,” producing more than eight billion pairs each year.\r\nBy the mid-1990s, when Jack was starting his own business\r\ncareer, Zhejiang was already an entrepreneurial powerhouse. But the\r\nprovince’s companies were highly labor-intensive and their average\r\nsize small. From hardly any entrepreneurs at the beginning of the\r\n1980s, by 1994 Zhejiang arguably had too many. In a population of\r\n44 million people, the province was home to an estimated 10 million\r\neconomic entities.\r\nMany manufacturers struggled to find enough customers to make\r\na profit. Unlike the factories in southern China set up by wealthy\r\noverseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Taiwan, the small factories in\r\nZhejiang had to hustle to find customers and finance.6 China’s stateowned\r\nbanks denied them any credit. This chronic lack of funding\r\ncreated innovations in private finance, such as the Wenzhou model,\r\nand led to the rise of industrial clusters that bound together debtors\r\nand creditors, who could dole out capital based on the profit they\r\nbelieved would be generated by a specific contract. By 2004, of the\r\ntop hundred largest domestic private firms in China, half came from\r\nZhejiang Province.\r\nJack recognized early on both the region’s strengths and its\r\nshortcomings, and is a proud advocate for the province. Since\r\nOctober 2015, he serves as the inaugural chairman of the General\r\nAssociation of Zhejiang Entrepreneurs. In his inaugural speech, Jack\r\ntalked about the six million Zhejiang entrepreneurs in China and the\r\ntwo million Zhejiang entrepreneurs around the world: “The total\r\nnumber of over eight million Zhejiang entrepreneurs might be the\r\nlargest business association in the world. They have created another\r\neconomic entity in addition to the local economy in Zhejiang.” Their\r\nsuccesses weren’t won easily though. In an earlier speech to the\r\nZhejiang Chamber of Commerce, Jack summed up the dynamism of\r\nhis home province: “As entrepreneurs from Zhejiang, our greatest\r\nadvantages are that we are hardworking, courageous, and good at\r\nseizing opportunities. We have these excellent qualities because we\r\nwere given nothing. We are not like other provinces which have\r\nresources of coal and ore. We Zhejiang entrepreneurs have markets.\r\n. . . As long as we are in places where there are people, we are\r\nalways able to find opportunities. It will be the same in the future.”\r\nYet Jack’s first effort to tap into Zhejiang’s entrepreneurial fizz\r\nwas not a success. In 1994, his Hope Translation venture had gotten\r\noff to a troubled start. While his monthly office rent was almost $300,\r\nhis first month’s income was just over $20. Hope may spring eternal,\r\nbut cash is king. Jack was facing a crunch. To support his venture,\r\nJack started peddling goods on the streets of Hangzhou, including\r\nsome he sourced from Yiwu. His translation company also became a\r\ntrading company. Hope Translation Agency started to sell gifts,\r\nflowers, books, and even plastic carpet, a range of items that\r\nforeshadows Taobao. Jack recalled, “We did everything. This income\r\nsupported the translation agency for three years until we started to\r\nmake ends meet. We believed that as long as we kept doing it, we\r\nwould definitely have a future.”\r\nBut it was becoming clear to Jack that translation services alone\r\nwere not going to sate his entrepreneurial ambitions. Soon an\r\nunexpected journey, which looked at first like a disaster, was about to\r\ngive Jack a lucky break.\r\nWith his reputation as an expert English speaker growing from\r\nhis popular evening classes and his Hope Translation venture, Jack\r\nwas asked by the government of Tonglu County—some fifty miles to\r\nthe southwest of Hangzhou and later home to the Tonglu Gang of\r\nlogistic companies—to assist as an interpreter in helping resolve a\r\ndispute with an American company over the construction of a new\r\nhighway.\r\nIn 1994, the company had proposed to invest in a new highway\r\nto be built from Hangzhou to Tonglu. After a year of negotiations, no\r\nagreement had been reached, and the initial funding promised by the\r\npartner in the United States had not materialized. Jack was tapped to\r\nfind out what was going on, and hopefully end the deadlock.\r\nFirst Jack traveled to Hong Kong, where he was told that the\r\ncompany’s funds were held in the United States, so Jack embarked\r\non his first trip there. He would stay for a month. His mission for the\r\nTonglu government was a failure. But the trip would give him his first\r\nexposure to the Internet, and he would return to China a changed\r\nman.\r\nGoing to America\r\nHis first trip to America sounds more like a plot for an Ocean’s\r\nEleven–style crime caper than an interpreter’s business trip, at least\r\naccording to the version put out five years later during the dot-com\r\nboom when media started to take an interest in Jack’s background.\r\nUpon arriving in Los Angeles, the story goes, Jack met with the\r\nunnamed boss of Tonglu’s erstwhile U.S. partner. Jack quickly figured\r\nout, as The Economist related, that the “company he was\r\ninvestigating did not exist, that his host was a crook, and that he\r\nhimself was in serious danger.” Jack has never named the boss, later\r\ndescribed in local media only as a “bulky Californian.” But after\r\nrefusing to take a bribe, Jack recalled he was locked in a beach\r\nhouse in Malibu, where his captor flashed a gun. He was then taken\r\nto Las Vegas, where he was kept in a form of house arrest in a hotel\r\nroom on the top floor of a casino. Jack hasn’t repeated the details of\r\nany of this in recent years. His personal assistant, Chen Wei, has\r\nwritten that it is an episode that Jack prefers to forget. A few years\r\nafter the incident, when Alibaba was beginning to gain international\r\nprominence, Jack told a similar story to Melinda Liu, the Beijing\r\nbureau chief for Newsweek: “I flew to Hangzhou for an exclusive\r\ninterview with Jack, and he spent a generous amount of time showing\r\nme around the Alibaba headquarters and talking at length about his\r\nlife. He said that, on his very first trip to the USA, a former business\r\ncontact (an American) had ‘virtually kidnapped’ him in a failed attempt\r\nto get Jack to work for him. At the time, Jack was pretty matter-offact,\r\nand the anecdote was just one of many he recounted. I later\r\ncontacted him requesting more information; he indicated he didn’t\r\nwant to make too much of it and declined to provide additional\r\ndetails.” The bizarre story ends with Jack escaping his hotel room\r\nand winning $600 on slot machines in the casino. Abandoning his\r\nbelongings upstairs, he escapes the casino and buys an airline ticket\r\nfor Seattle. A less colorful version of the story was detailed in an\r\narticle published in September 1995 in the Hangzhou Daily,7 which\r\nsays Jack had taken along $4,000 in savings and money borrowed\r\nfrom his wife Cathy’s mother and his brother-in-law.\r\nIn any event, it was in Seattle that Jack first logged on to the\r\nInternet. He had heard about the Internet the previous year from a\r\nfellow English teacher in Hangzhou, called Bill Aho. Bill’s son-in-law\r\nwas working on an Internet-related business, which Bill described.\r\nJack recalled that it was Bill who first told him about the Internet, but\r\nthat he “couldn’t explain it clearly either, it sounded very strange. . . . I\r\ncouldn’t really understand it either.”\r\nIn Seattle, Jack stayed at the house of Bill Aho’s relatives, Dave\r\nand Dolores Selig.\r\nJack was shown around the wealthier districts of the city,\r\nincluding the Queen Anne neighborhood. Dolores Selig recalled to\r\nthe BBC that Jack was impressed by some of the larger houses on\r\nthe hill: “Jack would point at various houses and say ‘I’m going to buy\r\nthat one, and that one and that one’ and we’d just laugh because they\r\nwere very expensive houses. But he was impressed.” Bill Aho\r\nremembered, “At that time, he didn’t have a nickel.”\r\nJack then met Bill Aho’s son-in-law, Stuart Trusty, who had set up\r\nan Internet consultancy called Virtual Broadcast Network (VBN),\r\nlocated in the U.S. Bank building on Fifth Avenue near Pike Street in\r\ndowntown Seattle.\r\n“Jack came and I showed him what the Internet was,” Trusty\r\nrecalled. “Back then, the Internet was largely a directory for\r\ngovernments and businesses, but he seemed excited.”\r\nFor Jack the visit to Seattle was a transformative experience: “It\r\nwas my first trip to the States, the first time in my life I touched a\r\nkeyboard and computers, the first time in my life I connected to the\r\nInternet, and the first time I decided to leave as a teacher and start a\r\ncompany.”\r\nJack recalled his first online session: “My friend Stuart . . . said,\r\n‘Jack, this is Internet. You can find whatever you can find through the\r\nInternet.’ I say really? So I searched the word beer. Very simple word.\r\nI don’t know why I searched for beer. But I found American beer,\r\nGermany [sic] beer and no Chinese beer. . . . I was curious, so I\r\nsearched ‘China,’ and no ‘China,’ no data.”\r\nIntrigued, Jack asked Stuart for help. “I talked to my friend, ‘Why\r\ndon’t I make something about China?’ So we made a small, very\r\nugly-looking page . . . [for the] translation agency I listed on there.”\r\nThe site for Hope Translation was just text, without any images,\r\nplus a telephone number and the price for translation work.\r\nJack later recalled to the journalist Charlie Rose: “It was so\r\nshocking, we launched it nine forty in the morning, twelve thirty I got a\r\nphone call from my friend. ‘Jack, you’ve got five emails.’ I said, ‘What\r\nis email?’” Three emails came from the United States, one from\r\nJapan, and one from Germany.\r\nJack set about formulating the idea for a new business—helping\r\nChinese companies find export channels online—and pitched the\r\nidea of a partnership with VBN.\r\nStuart, who developed a love of tai chi from Jack—he still\r\npractices in Atlanta today—recalled Jack as intensely focused on\r\nwork.\r\n“We’d go down to the office, we’d do our work, then we’d get\r\nsomething to eat, go back home maybe do more tai chi and it was\r\njust that way . . . every day. No extra curricular activities.”\r\nJack’s dealings with VBN weren’t easy. Stuart asked for an\r\nupfront deposit of $200,0008 to grant Jack the exclusive right to make\r\nWeb pages in China. When Jack explained that he had borrowed\r\nmoney to make the trip to the United States and was now penniless,\r\nStuart signed the agreement without the deposit but on the condition\r\nthat Jack pay up as soon as possible, even enlisting Bill Aho and his\r\nwife as guarantors. To get home to Hangzhou, according to a local\r\nmedia report, Jack had to borrow funds from a Hangzhou student in\r\nthe States, then flew to Shanghai.\r\nFor his client in Tonglu, Jack returned to China empty-handed,\r\nwith no deal to finance the proposed highway. But inside his suitcase\r\nhe carried back with him a computer running the Intel 486 processor:\r\n“It was the most advanced in China at that time.”\r\nBack in Hangzhou he set about building his concept of an online\r\nyellow pages. He named the business China Pages. In this, his\r\nsecond venture, he would dive headfirst into the entrepreneurial sea,\r\nleaving his teaching days behind.\r\nChapter Five\r\nChina Is Coming On\r\nIf traditional industry and e-commerce “successfully merge together,\r\nthere will be no limit to China’s next round of economic development.”\r\n—Jack Ma\r\nSoon after returning from Seattle to Hangzhou, Jack resigned his\r\nposition as a teacher at the Hangzhou Institute of Electronic\r\nEngineering. He had realized that his teaching days must end when\r\nhe ran into the dean, who was riding his bicycle carrying vegetables\r\nhe had just bought from the market. The dean encouraged him to\r\nkeep working hard at teaching, but looking at the bicycle and the\r\nvegetables Jack realized that even if he were to become dean himself\r\none day, this was a future he couldn’t get excited about.\r\nHis new dream wasn’t teaching or translating. Fresh from his first\r\ncontact with the Internet, he would build an online index, in English, of\r\nbusinesses in China seeking customers overseas.\r\nAs Stuart Trusty had noticed back in Seattle, Jack had a\r\ntremendous work ethic. To populate China Pages with entries, he\r\ntoiled away collecting information on companies, which he would\r\ntranslate into English, then send along with photos to VBN in Seattle\r\nfor uploading to the website.\r\nIn March 1995, Jack convened a gathering of two dozen of his\r\nnight school students to present his concept and seek their advice, as\r\nwell as their business. “I asked the most active and capable people\r\nfrom my evening classes to my home. I talked about two hours, they\r\nlistened to me, obviously confused. . . . Eventually lots of people cast\r\ntheir votes. Twenty-three of them said it would not work out. Only one\r\nperson—now he is working at Agricultural Bank of China—said to me:\r\nIf you want to try, then go ahead, but if it doesn’t work out, come back\r\nas soon as you can.”\r\nUndeterred, he pressed ahead. Together with his friend He\r\nYibing, a computer science teacher at the institute Jack had just left,\r\nJack launched China Pages. The two had met the year before when\r\nHe Yibing was looking for someone to help him practice his English\r\nahead of a training trip to Singapore. There, He Yibing gained\r\nexposure to the Internet. When Jack returned from Seattle with a\r\ndream of building an Internet company, the two decided to work\r\ntogether.\r\nChina Pages\r\nThe company they registered, Hangzhou Haibo Network Consulting\r\n(HHNC), was one of the first in China devoted to the Internet. To fund\r\nhis start-up Jack borrowed money from his relatives, including his\r\nsister, brother-in-law, and parents. Jack’s wife, Cathy, was the first\r\nemployee.\r\nIn April 1995, Jack and He Yibing opened the first office for\r\nChina Pages in a twelve-square-meter office building at 38 Wen’er\r\nRoad. To portray their business as a solid concern, Jack and He\r\nYibing printed up several versions of their business cards, each listing\r\ndifferent positions1 that they would use depending on whom they\r\nwere meeting. During the day, the two partners went out to find\r\nclients, returning in the evening to teach an introductory training\r\ncourse about the “information superhighway.” This class helped\r\ngenerate some of China Pages’ early customers.\r\nOn May 10, 1995, they registered the domain name\r\nchinapages.com in the United States. In July they officially launched\r\ntheir website, which featured a red-framed map of Asia, with China\r\nhighlighted under the title “China Business Pages: The Online China\r\nBusiness Directory.”\r\nThe website’s home page indicated chinapages.com was\r\n“Broadcast via Seattle, USA from Hangzhou, the Garden City.” The\r\nsite featured tabs including “What’s New!,” “What’s Cool!,” “Net\r\nSearch,” and “Net Directory,” and a link to Hope, his translation\r\nventure.\r\nChina Pages started off as a family affair. Jack’s wife, Cathy, her\r\nsister Zhang Jing, and He Yibing’s girlfriend all lent a hand.\r\nJack’s former students also provided a ready pool of talent for\r\nChina Pages. Jane Jiang (Jiang Fang), whom Jack had taught at the\r\ninstitute a few years earlier, took charge of customer service. One\r\nvisitor to China Pages in those early days was Cui Luhai, who ran a\r\ncomputer animation business. Now a lecturer at the China Academy\r\nof Art, Cui commented, “I can still remember the first scene I saw\r\nwhen I walked into his office. . . . It was a pretty empty space with\r\nonly one desk set up in the middle of the room. There was only one\r\nvery old PC desktop surrounded by a lot of people.” Cui learned that\r\nJack had spent most of his money on registering the business,\r\nleaving little leftover for hardware or other equipment.\r\nChina Pages badly needed customers. Cathy signed up one of\r\nthe first clients, who paid them eight thousand yuan ($960). The\r\ncompany received a boost when Hangzhou was selected in May to\r\nhold the Formula One Powerboat World Championship later that\r\nyear, the first time the event would be held in China. Jack’s venture\r\nwon the contract to make the official website for the race.\r\nTo win more clients, as with Hope Translation beforehand, Jack\r\ncalled on his former students to spread the word and bring in\r\nbusiness. Two of them duly obliged.\r\nHe Xiangyang, a former student of Jack’s, was working at the\r\nQianjiang Law Firm. Reluctant to list the firm’s name on the Internet,\r\nhe gave Jack his personal phone number instead. To his surprise, he\r\nstarted to receive phone calls around the clock from prospective\r\nclients, many overseas, who told him they’d got his number from\r\nChina Pages. The once-skeptical lawyer started to think there might\r\nbe something to Jack’s story about the Internet after all.\r\nAnother former student was Zhou Lan, who would become\r\nJack’s secretary. Zhou was working at the Lakeview Hotel in\r\nHangzhou when Jack made a website for them, featuring the hotel’s\r\nbrand-new fourteen-inch color TVs. Later that year, the United\r\nNations held its Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing,\r\nattended by more than seventeen thousand participants, including\r\nFirst Lady Hillary Clinton. A number of delegates traveled on to\r\nHangzhou after the conference. Booking rooms at the Lakeview, they\r\ntold the hotel management it was the only hotel in Hangzhou they\r\ncould find online. By the following spring, the hotel had sold more\r\nrooms in the first three months than the previous year, another\r\ndemonstration of the power of the Internet.\r\nEven with the help of Jack’s former students, China Pages\r\nneeded more clients if it was going to survive. But demonstrating\r\nwhat China Pages was all about was not easy, for one very basic\r\nreason: In Hangzhou at the time it was impossible to get online.\r\nInstead Jack came up with an alternative approach. First, he\r\nspread the word through friends and contacts about what the Internet\r\ncould do for their business. He then asked those interested to send\r\nhim marketing materials to introduce their companies and products.\r\nNext Jack and his colleagues translated the materials, and sent the\r\nmaterial by mail to VBN in Seattle. VBN then designed the websites\r\nand put them online. They then printed out screenshots of the\r\nwebsites and mailed them to Hangzhou. Finally, Jack took the printed\r\nmaterials to his friends and announced that, although they couldn’t\r\ncheck this themselves, their websites were now online. But without\r\nInternet access in Hangzhou it was a challenge even explaining to his\r\ncustomers what “online” actually meant. As sales pitches go, asking\r\npeople who had never heard of the Internet to fork over 20,000\r\nrenminbi ($2,400) up front to create, design, and host a website they\r\ncould never see was a challenging one. Jack worried that people\r\nthought he was defrauding them. “I was treated like a con man for\r\nthree years,” he said.\r\nFirst Connection\r\nFinally, in the fall of 1995, Zhejiang Telecom started to provide\r\nInternet access services in Hangzhou. By the end of the year there\r\nwere only 204 Internet users in the whole province. But Jack was\r\namong them and was finally able to load a website in front of his first\r\nclient, the Lakeview Hotel, on the 486 computer he’d brought back\r\nfrom Seattle in his suitcase. “It took three and a half hours to\r\ndownload the front page. . . . I was so excited.”\r\nStarting with Deng Xiaoping’s reforms, China experienced an\r\nentrepreneurial explosion that began to replace Marx with the market,\r\nbecoming a socialist country “with Chinese characteristics.” But this\r\ndid not mean the Communist Party was going to ease up on a central\r\npillar of its rule, the control of information. China has a long tradition\r\nof controlling information, but especially so under the rule of the\r\nCommunist Party. It is surprising, therefore, that the country ever\r\nconnected to the Internet at all. The fact that it did illustrates the\r\nChinese government’s often contradictory desires to maintain control\r\nwhile simultaneously unlocking greater economic opportunities.\r\nWithout the Internet, Jack’s vision of connecting entrepreneurs\r\nwith global markets would have never been realized.\r\nOn September 14, 1987, while Jack was still a university student,\r\nthe very first email from China was sent by Professor Qian Tianbai at\r\nPeking University to Karlsruhe University in what was then West\r\nGermany. The email, in English and German, read, “Across the Great\r\nWall we can reach every corner in the world.” The email was sent at\r\n300 bits per second (bps), an impossibly slow connection by today’s\r\ntypical consumer broadband speeds measured by the tens or\r\nhundreds of millions of bps. It would be another seven years before\r\nChina was connected to the Internet proper.\r\nWhile the Chinese government was thinking about what to do\r\nabout the Internet—wrestling with issues of ideology, control, and\r\ninfrastructure—the U.S. government was pondering the wisdom of\r\nbringing a communist country online. In the end, it was not politicians\r\nbut scientists,2 on both sides of the Pacific, who took the lead. After\r\nyears of efforts, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in\r\nMenlo Park, California, connected3 with the Institute of High Energy\r\nPhysics (IHEP), 5,800 miles away in Beijing.\r\nWhile this was just a connection between two institutions, other\r\nscientists wanted to set up their own links. Connecting SLAC-IHEP to\r\nthe Internet was a much easier solution than stringing up new links\r\nfrom other locations in the United States to IHEP. As Dr. Les Cottrell\r\nat SLAC recalled, “We explored this only to find out that the DOD\r\n[Department of Defense], the DOE [Department of Energy], the State\r\nDepartment all were very concerned about this.” But eventually the\r\nU.S. government agreed, “They said okay, you can do this as long as\r\nyou tell everybody who is on the Internet that China’s coming on.”\r\nLes wasn’t quite sure how to “tell everybody” on the Internet but\r\neventually it was agreed that he would send an email to a particular\r\ndistribution list. On May 17, 1994, the first real Internet connection to\r\nChina was established.\r\nAlthough IHEP was host to China’s first Web pages, the Internet\r\nsoon became more than a privilege reserved for particle physicists.\r\nAt the same time as this first connection was being established,\r\nChina was on the verge of a massive expansion in its\r\ncommunications infrastructure, a policy it called “informatization”\r\n(xinxihua). China’s communist rulers had watched the collapse of the\r\nSoviet Union in 1990 with alarm, attributing it in part to the yawning\r\ntechnological gap that had opened up with the United States. At the\r\nbeginning of 1994 China had only 27 million phone lines and 640,000\r\ncell phones for a population of 1.2 billion. The early users of cell\r\nphones were either government officials or the getihu who could\r\nafford to shell out $2,000 to buy one, with others making do with\r\npagers.\r\nThe Chinese government resolved to change this, seeing an\r\nimprovement in telecommunications as a tangible improvement they\r\ncould deliver in the lives of the masses. Just as King Henry IV of\r\nFrance cemented his legitimacy by putting a chicken on every dinner\r\ntable on a Sunday, with xinxihua the Chinese Communist Party\r\nbegan to roll out phone lines, then cell phones, then broadband\r\nconnections to hundreds of millions of people.\r\nIn 1993, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji launched the Golden Bridge\r\nProject to create an information and communications network\r\nspanning the whole country. In 1994, the government ended the\r\nmonopoly of telecom services held by the Ministry of Posts and\r\nTelecommunications (MPT). To inject some competition into the\r\nmarket, a second carrier, called China Unicom, was established.\r\nOther countries, starting with the United Kingdom, had used private\r\ncapital to finance the competitors taking on state-owned telecom\r\nincumbents. China, obsessed with control of information, could not\r\ncontemplate this—twenty years on it still hasn’t—and opted instead to\r\nlaunch China Unicom as a new state-owned enterprise, backed by\r\nthree other ministries and a number of other state-owned enterprises,\r\neffectively pitting one government department against a coalition of\r\nother departments in a uniquely Chinese approach to telecom\r\nderegulation.\r\nSpurred into action by the loss of its monopoly, the new minister\r\nof MPT, Wu Jichuan, responded with massive new investment in\r\ntelecom infrastructure.\r\nDuring a visit by U.S. secretary of commerce Ron Brown to\r\nBeijing shortly after the first SLAC-IHEP Internet connection was\r\nestablished, China signed an agreement with Sprint to set up a new\r\nInternet connection linking Beijing and Shanghai with the United\r\nStates. This was the beginning of the “ChinaNet” Internet service\r\nprovider link that would allow members of the public, including Jack,\r\nto dial up to the Internet in China for the first time.\r\nChina’s First Technology Entrepreneurs\r\nAs word spread that China was finally investing in its telecom\r\ninfrastructure, the country’s first technology entrepreneurs began to\r\nemerge. Mostly U.S.-educated engineers, they started new ventures\r\nto help build out China’s communications networks. One of the most\r\nprominent was James Ding (Ding Jian), a master’s graduate in\r\ninformation science from the University of California, Los Angeles.\r\nAfter the suppression of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen\r\nSquare in June 1989, he and many other U.S.-educated Chinese\r\ninstead shifted their hopes for radical political change in China to a\r\nfaith in the power of technology to reshape the country. In 1993,\r\nJames Ding joined forces with Beijing-born Edward Tian (Tian\r\nSuning), who had recently completed a Ph.D. at Texas Tech, to\r\ncofound AsiaInfo. In 1995, they moved the company’s operations to\r\nBeijing to work on the data network buildout for China’s telcos,\r\nincluding China Telecom’s ChinaNet dial-up Internet access network.\r\nEdward Tian would go on to become a leading figure in China’s\r\ntelecom market, and both he and James Ding would become highprofile\r\ninvestors in the technology sector.\r\nIn 1995, another influential Chinese technology firm, UTStarcom,\r\nwas formed. Started by Chinese and Taiwanese entrepreneurs in the\r\nUnited States, the company soon set up its China operations in\r\nHangzhou. UTStarcom would play an important role in spurring the\r\ngrowth of China’s telecom market by promoting a low-cost mobile\r\nsystem called Little Smart (xiaolingtong). This success helped put\r\nHangzhou on the map for investors as a technology hub.\r\nA key investor in UTStarcom in 1995 was the newly established\r\nJapanese investment fund SoftBank, a firm that five years later would\r\nstart to play a critical role in the success of Alibaba. Founded by\r\nJapanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, SoftBank took a 30 percent\r\nstake in UTStarcom.\r\nUTStarcom was formed by the merger of Unitech Industries and\r\nStarcom Network Systems. Unitech’s Taiwanese founder, Lu\r\nHongliang, had studied with Masayoshi Son at the University of\r\nCalifornia, Berkeley. Starcom’s cofounder, Chauncey Shey, went on\r\nto head SoftBank China Venture Capital, which led Masayoshi Son’s\r\ninvestment in Alibaba in 2000.\r\nBy late 1995, with China’s telecom and Internet buildout\r\nbeginning to gain momentum, Jack and his customers were finally\r\nable to connect to the Internet from Hangzhou, using the ChinaNet\r\nservice that had already been rolled out in Beijing, Shanghai, and\r\nGuangzhou. Soon after, Jack traveled back to the United States with\r\nLi Qi, his newly appointed chief engineer, to visit VBN in Seattle. On\r\nreturning to China they ended their venture with VBN, setting up their\r\nown servers and a new China Pages site.\r\nThis helped cut costs, but boosting revenues was proving hard.\r\nIn 1995, only 1.5 million personal computers were sold in China,\r\nmostly to business or government users. Priced at roughly $1,800,\r\nthe PCs cost a fortune for average Chinese at the time. The costs of\r\ngetting a fixed line installed and getting online, combined with a lack\r\nof awareness about what the Internet actually was, meant that China\r\nPages was having a hard time finding enough customers.\r\nJack stepped up his efforts to evangelize the Internet. He even\r\nenlisted Bill Gates, in a manner of speaking. In late 1995, Gates’s\r\nbook The Road Ahead became an instant bestseller in the United\r\nStates and soon after in China, too. Although the book hardly\r\nmentioned4 the World Wide Web, to convince prospective clients of\r\nthe importance of the Internet Jack started citing a quote from Bill\r\nGates: “The Internet will change every aspect of human beings’\r\nlives.” A useful marketing message for China Pages, Jack had in fact\r\nmade it up, as he later confessed, “In 1995, the world started to know\r\nBill Gates. But if I said, ‘Jack Ma says that the Internet will change\r\nevery aspect of human beings’ lives,’ who would believe it?” But, he\r\nadded, “I believed that Bill Gates would definitely say it one day.”\r\n(Shortly after the book was released, Gates famously did realize the\r\nimportance of the Internet, dramatically stepping up Microsoft’s efforts\r\nand releasing a second edition of the book with a much greater\r\nemphasis on the Internet.)\r\nMeanwhile, in Beijing, an entrepreneur, Jasmine Zhang (Zhang\r\nShuxin), had started to attract growing media interest after founding\r\nin May 1995 one of China’s first privately owned Internet service\r\nbusinesses. She called her venture Yinghaiwei, a rough, phonetic\r\nequivalent in Chinese of the English term “Information Highway.”\r\nOther China Internet founders credit her as the source of inspiration\r\nfor starting their own ventures. One told me: “One day I was driving to\r\nwork and saw one of their billboard ads saying, ‘How far is China\r\naway from the Information Highway? Fifteen hundred meters ahead,’”\r\nreferring to the company’s office. Building on a tradition of internal\r\nBBS (bulletin board systems), popular in leading academic\r\ninstitutions such as Tsinghua and Peking universities, the company\r\nstarted to serve a few hundred users keen to experience the Internet,\r\nthen mostly dominated by websites in English, and share comments\r\nin Chinese about what they were discovering.\r\nBack in Hangzhou, Jack stepped up his efforts to promote his\r\nown venture, scoring a breakthrough when the Zhejiang provincial\r\ngovernment invited China Pages to build its website. The government\r\nofficial in charge of commissioning the website, Yang Jianxin, later\r\nrecalled his dealings with Jack: “The first time he came to my office,\r\nfrankly speaking, as I understood him to be an Internet guru I didn’t\r\nexpect to meet such a young guy.” Jack launched enthusiastically into\r\nan explanation of the Internet. Yang recalled Jack talked “nonstop for\r\ntwo hours.” Although Yang indicated the government was unable to\r\npay for the project, as its impact was unknown, Jack and his team\r\nquickly built the site, hosted by China Pages, in cooperation with a\r\nlocal unit of Zhejiang Telecom called Hangzhou Dife Communications\r\n—a partnership that soon after would sour dramatically. The site was\r\none of the first projects in a national initiative5 to bring the Chinese\r\ngovernment online, generating a lot of publicity for Zhejiang. Within a\r\nfew days Yang received congratulatory emails from overseas,\r\nincluding from members of the U.S. Congress.6 The coverage also\r\nboosted Jack’s profile, a local newspaper7 ran a feature story on his\r\ncompany and his dramatic first visit to the United States.\r\nBut the publicity also triggered problems for Jack and the official\r\nwho had commissioned him. One of Yang’s colleagues reported him\r\nto the provincial government, accusing him of “hobnobbing with a\r\ngetihu.” The disgruntled colleague’s report thundered that\r\n“government information dissemination was a serious issue, how\r\ncould it be handled and published via a getihu?”\r\nAfter encountering resistance at the local level, Jack started to\r\nspend most of his time in Beijing. There he met up with Jasmine\r\nZhang of Yinghaiwei. The two did not hit it off, Jack later sharing his\r\nfirst impressions: “I though if the Internet’s demise comes one day,\r\nhers will be earlier than mine. I was already very idealistic, but here\r\nwas someone who was even more idealistic than me.”\r\nJack and his partner, He Yibing, set about raising the profile of\r\nChina Pages in Beijing. Jack had brought with him some articles he\r\nhad written about the Internet, and asked his friends to help publish\r\nthem. In Beijing, thanks to a relationship with a driver at the\r\npublication who was introduced by a friend, he met Sun Yanjun,\r\ndeputy editor in chief of China Trade News. Sun was impressed by\r\nChina Pages and invited Jack to give a lecture about the Internet to\r\nhis colleagues. Afterward he published a front-page article on Jack\r\nand his company.\r\nWhile Jack was good at gaining publicity, China Pages still\r\nwasn’t winning much business, and its efforts to open doors with the\r\ncentral government came to naught. In July 1996, China’s national\r\nbroadcaster, China Central Television, broadcast a documentary\r\ncalled Ma Yun the Scholar, which showed Jack being rebuffed by a\r\ngovernment official. The documentary was produced by Fan Xinman,\r\nmarried to the famous director Zhang Jizhong, who has brought a\r\nnumber of Jin Yong novels to the screen. Fan was also from\r\nHangzhou and sympathetic to Jack’s cause. As she filmed Jack\r\ngetting shown the cold shoulder, Fan became increasingly concerned\r\nfor Jack’s prospects: “He no longer had his base in Hangzhou, and\r\nwas crushed in Beijing. He was almost bankrupt.” In the documentary,\r\nthrough a window to the Beijing streets outside, Jack made a\r\nresolution to himself: “In a few years, you won’t treat me like this; in a\r\nfew years, you will all know what I do. And I won’t be in dire straits in\r\nBeijing.”\r\nThe problem for China Pages was that it really was just a\r\ndirectory. The site was pretty rudimentary, merely listings of a\r\ncompany’s products for sale. There was no way for prospective\r\ncustomers to make purchases online, so there was a limit on what\r\nChina Pages could charge for its services.8\r\nSqueezed Out\r\nChina Pages was running out of cash to meet its payroll. Switching\r\nsales staff to commission-based pay relieved the pressure for a while,\r\nas did a 10,000-yuan contract from a client in the textile industry. But\r\nChina Pages was in a vulnerable state. Yet things were about to get\r\nmuch worse. The company that had worked with China Pages to\r\nbuild the Zhejiang government website, Hangzhou Dife\r\nCommunication, made a bid to take over the company. China Pages\r\nwas a small, privately owned company, but Hangzhou Dife was a unit\r\nof a powerful SOE, Zhejiang Telecom. In February 1996 the two\r\nentered into a joint-venture, Dife-Hope. Dife had a 70 percent stake in\r\nthe venture, investing 1.4 million renminbi ($170,000). Jack would\r\nremain the general manager and China Pages would hold the\r\nremaining 30 percent, which was valued at 600,000 renminbi\r\n($70,000). At the time, this seemed like a significant achievement for\r\na tiny, cash-strapped company. Zhang Xinjian, then an official with\r\nHangzhou Telecom, termed it the first merger and acquisition\r\ntransaction in the history of China’s Internet; local media9 provided\r\npositive coverage of the joint venture.\r\nBut the reality was a lot more sinister. Jack had discovered that\r\nwhen working with China Pages on the Zhejiang government website,\r\nDife had registered the domain name www.chinesepages.com, very\r\nsimilar to his own venture’s www.chinapages.com, and a new\r\ncompany called “China Yellow Pages.” Yet because Dife was a\r\nsubsidiary of a powerful SOE, Jack couldn’t fight back. Gritting his\r\nteeth he had to give interviews with local media lauding the new\r\nventure: “The establishment of Dife-Haibo will further strengthen\r\nChina Pages.” He concluded by saying, “We have every reason to\r\nbelieve, with the right policies of the Party and the State, and with the\r\ntremendous support from every walk of life in the society, China\r\nPages will surely achieve great success. China’s information highspeed\r\ntrain will be faster and faster!”\r\nYears later, after Alibaba had become successful, Jack was free\r\nto comment on the experience. China Pages was dwarfed by its new\r\npartner, and while Jack was the general manager, the position turned\r\nout to be of little value. “When the joint venture was formed, disaster\r\nfollowed. They had five votes on the board, and we had two.\r\nWhenever there was a board meeting, whatever ideas I put forward, if\r\none of them voted against it, the rest of them followed suit. During\r\nfive or six board meetings, none of our ideas were passed.”\r\nJack had lost control of his pioneering venture: “At that time I\r\ncalled myself a blind man riding on the back of blind tigers. Without\r\nknowing anything about technology or computers, I started the first\r\ncompany. And after years of terrible experience, we failed.”\r\nThe China Pages episode provided him with some important\r\nlessons, as well as good material for his speeches, such as, “It is\r\ndifficult for an elephant to trample an ant to death, as long as you can\r\ndodge well,” and “With good strategies, you will definitely survive. To\r\nthis day, I’ve realized one thing: Don’t be nervous if you face huge\r\ncompetition in the future.” He would later draw on his experiences\r\nwhen taking Alibaba into battle against eBay, in the David versus\r\nGoliath struggle that would raise his profile on the global stage.\r\nJack also points to China Pages as influencing the way he would\r\nstructure his subsequent ventures: “From then on, I have held a firm\r\nbelief: When I start businesses in future, I will never hold the\r\ncontrolling stake of a company, making those controlled by me suffer.\r\nI will give plenty of understanding and support to lower levels. I have\r\nnever once had a controlling stake at Alibaba. I am proud of this. I am\r\nthe CEO of the company, because I lead it with [my] wisdom,\r\ncourage, and resourcefulness, not capital.”\r\nIn November 1997, Jack convened an off-site meeting with the\r\nChina Pages team in Tonglu, announcing that he was giving up his\r\nstake in China Pages and moving to Beijing, leaving his partner He\r\nYibing as CEO.\r\nJack’s invented quote that the Internet would change everything\r\nwas right. The problem was he had launched his venture too soon.\r\nJack put his dreams on hold, taking a job in Beijing at a unit of the\r\nMinistry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).\r\nThere he was like a fish out of water, counting the days until he could\r\njump back into the entrepreneurial sea of China’s Internet, which was\r\nabout to get a whole lot bigger.\r\nChapter Six\r\nBubble and Birth\r\nAlibaba might as well be known as “1,001 mistakes.” But there were\r\nthree main reasons why we survived. We didn’t have any money, we\r\ndidn’t have any technology, and we didn’t have a plan.\r\n—Jack Ma\r\nThird time lucky. After his struggles with Hope Translation and China\r\nPages and an uncomfortable period working for the government in\r\nBeijing, Jack went on to found Alibaba at the beginning of 1999. But\r\nextricating himself from China Pages and then from his government\r\njob cost him two years. Meanwhile, other Internet entrepreneurs in\r\nChina began to gain traction. Without a venture of his own Jack was\r\nrunning the risk of becoming irrelevant.\r\nJust as Jack had lost control of China Pages to his SOE-linked\r\npartner, in Beijing Jasmine Zhang had been forced out of Yinghaiwei\r\nby her largest shareholder, rumored to be connected with China’s\r\nMinistry of State Security. Other entrepreneurs, especially those who\r\nhad set up Internet service providers (ISPs) to roll out dial-up services\r\nto consumers, found themselves squeezed out by large SOEs like\r\nChina Telecom. Yun Tao from Beijing-based ISP Cenpok summed it\r\nup:1 “It is not yet possible to make money in China on the Internet. . .\r\n. I have been at it for the last few years and I tell you, I am bleeding\r\nnow.”\r\nWhile the telecom SOEs were actively protecting their turf from\r\nencroachment by the private sector, China’s state-owned media\r\ncompanies proved surprisingly incapable of competing with\r\nentrepreneurs building out Internet content businesses. A new\r\ngeneration of Internet entrepreneurs was coming to the fore in China,\r\ninspired by Yahoo, the most influential company of the dot-com boom\r\ngaining speed in the United States.\r\nListed in 1996, Yahoo at first commanded little attention from\r\ninvestors. They preferred established technology companies, which\r\nthey could value with traditional measures such as price/earning\r\nratios (P/E ratios). But Yahoo and its generation of dot-com\r\ncompanies were years from becoming profitable. Fortune magazine’s\r\nJoe Nocera later summed up the valuation challenge: “You can’t have\r\na P/E ratio when you have no ‘E.’” But all of this started to change in\r\nthe summer of 1998. Yahoo’s shares ran up more than 80 percent in\r\njust five weeks, taking the company’s valuation to $9 billion and\r\nmaking billionaires of its Stanford cofounders, Jerry Yang (Yang\r\nZhiyuan in Chinese) and David Filo. The dot-coms that had sprouted\r\nup in Silicon Valley now suddenly were the center of attention for Wall\r\nStreet, too.\r\nIn China, the Taiwan-born Jerry Yang became a hero. The public\r\nwas fascinated to learn how an immigrant to the United States had\r\nbecome a billionaire before the age of thirty.\r\nSuddenly there was a flurry of interest in Yahoo’s “portal”\r\nbusiness model, its directories and search engine connecting users to\r\nthe rapidly expanding universe of online content. Chinese portals, or\r\nmen hu (literally “gateway”) began to appear. A triumvirate soon\r\nemerged as the country’s “portal pioneers”: Wang Zhidong, Charles\r\nZhang, and William Ding. Unlike Jack, they had all excelled at their\r\nstudies and had strong technical backgrounds. The firms they\r\nfounded were Sina, Sohu, and NetEase.\r\nPortal Pioneers\r\nWang Zhidong, the founder of Sina, was already well known, famous\r\nfor having created several popular Chinese language software\r\napplications—BD Win, Chinese Star, and RichWin—that helped\r\npeople in China use the Microsoft Windows operating system. Born in\r\n1967 to poor but well-educated parents in south China’s Guangdong\r\nProvince, Wang excelled in math and science. He secured a place at\r\nPeking University, where he studied radio electronics. In 1997, Wang\r\nwas the first of the three portal pioneers to raise significant outside\r\ninvestment—nearly $7 million—for his firm, Stone Rich Sight, based\r\non his proven track record as a software developer. In the summer\r\n1998 he launched a dedicated website featuring soccer results in\r\ntime for the FIFA World Cup held that year in France. This generated\r\na lot of traffic, and the company shifted its focus from software to the\r\nInternet, later merging with another company to become Sina.\r\nCharles Zhang (Zhang Chaoyang), the founder of Sohu, was\r\nborn in Xi’an. One month younger than Jack, he won entry to\r\nTsinghua University to study physics before heading on to the\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). After attaining a Ph.D.\r\nin physics, Charles stayed on as a postdoc, working to foster U.S.-\r\nChina relations through MIT’s Industrial Liaison Program. Inspired by\r\nthe success of Netscape and Yahoo, Charles decided to launch his\r\nown Internet company. His original plan was to launch it in the United\r\nStates, but as a recent Chinese immigrant he felt excluded from the\r\nmainstream, including being unable to attract the interest of the\r\nmedia—something unlike the two other media-shy portal founders—\r\nhe was particularly attached to. “I constantly thought I was an\r\noutsider. For example, here [in China] I receive interview invitations,\r\nbut in the States I would probably never have been able to be on their\r\nnews shows. So I came back.”\r\nCharles returned to Beijing in 1996. He set up his company with\r\nthe encouragement and financial support of two MIT professors,\r\nincluding Ed Roberts, who at the time of Sohu’s IPO four years later\r\nheld a 5 percent stake. Charles was the sole returning student,\r\nknown as “sea turtle” (haigui) of the three pioneers. His greater\r\nexposure to the U.S. technology scene gave Charles a head start. In\r\nFebruary 1998 he was the first of the three to launch a Chineselanguage\r\nsearch engine and a website directly inspired by Yahoo,\r\neven down to the name he chose for his venture: Sohoo.com, later\r\nchanging the name to Sohu.com.\r\nWilliam Ding (Ding Lei) was born in Ningbo, seven years after\r\nJack. He studied computer science in a technology university in\r\nChengdu. After returning home to Ningbo to work for the local branch\r\nof China Telecom, William moved to Guangzhou in southern China to\r\nwork for the U.S. database company Sybase, then for a local\r\ntechnology firm. In 1997 he launched his own venture, which rolled\r\nout the first free, bilingual email service in China. William’s venture\r\nsoon became profitable with the income generated by licensing the\r\nemail software to other companies. In the summer of 1998 William\r\nswitched his business from software development to the Internet and\r\nlaunched his website NetEase.com. Initially popular in southern\r\nChina, NetEase quickly signed up email users all over the country,\r\n1.4 million by the end of 1999.\r\nWhile Wang Zhidong, Charles, and William were surfing the\r\nwaves of China’s exciting new dot-com sea, Jack was languishing on\r\nthe dusty dot-gov shore. His job title was general manager of\r\nInfoshare Technology, a company set up by the China International\r\nElectronic Commerce Center (CIECC),2 itself a unit of a department\r\nof MOFTEC. At CIECC Jack led the development of MOFTEC’s\r\nofficial website, www.moftec.gov.cn, which launched in March 1998.\r\nCalling some of his China Pages colleagues to join him in Beijing,\r\nJack then developed another website for MOFTEC,\r\nwww.chinamarket.com.cn, which launched on July 1, 1998.\r\nThe China Market site, which listed more than eight thousand\r\ncommodities divided into six categories, invited visitors to post supply\r\nand demand information and enter into “confidential business\r\nnegotiations in encrypted Business ChatRooms.” The new site\r\nattracted the praise of government officials, including MOFTEC\r\nminister Shi Guangsheng, who called it a “solid step by China to\r\nmove into the age of e-commerce.” The official Chinese government\r\nnews agency, Xinhua, commended the site for its “information\r\nreliability and orderly operation,” with all visitors vetted by the\r\ngovernment to ensure that they were valid businesses.\r\nThe reality, though, was that all the offline bureaucracy involved\r\nin registering on the website made it unappealing to businesses,\r\nespecially because the website could not facilitate any orders or\r\npayments. In other words it was just a bigger and government-backed\r\nversion of China Pages. Jack fervently believed in the unfolding age\r\nof e-commerce, but he also knew that the future belonged to\r\nentrepreneurs, later recalling that “it was too tiring doing e-commerce\r\nin the government. . . . E-commerce should start with private\r\nenterprises.” Working for CIECC, Jack was buried by the many layers\r\nof government officials above him, including Xing Wei, his fierce boss\r\nat CIECC.3\r\nJack became increasingly frustrated as he watched the\r\ntriumvirate of portal pioneers gain momentum: “Here I was, I had\r\nbeen practicing for five years in the Internet field,” Jack recalled.\r\n“Everything was changing very quickly. If I stayed in Beijing I couldn’t\r\ndo something really big; I couldn’t realize my dreams as a public\r\nservant.”\r\nBut his government perch ended up giving Jack another lucky\r\nbreak: his first encounter with Jerry Yang, the cofounder of Yahoo. In\r\nthe coming years, the fates of Jack Ma and Jerry Yang would become\r\never more closely intertwined.\r\nAs the general manager of Infoshare, and a fluent English\r\nspeaker, Jack was asked to receive Jerry Yang and his colleagues,\r\nwho in late 1997 came to Beijing to look for opportunities for Yahoo in\r\nChina. Jack’s experience as a self-appointed tour guide in Hangzhou\r\ncame in handy now in Beijing since Jerry was traveling with his\r\nyounger brother Ken, and was keen to see some of the sights. Jack\r\nintroduced him to his wife, Cathy, and they took Jerry, Jerry’s brother,\r\nand Yahoo vice president Heather Killen to visit Beihai Park, opposite\r\nthe Forbidden City, and the Great Wall. Here they took a photo that\r\nwould play an important role in helping separate Jack from the pack,\r\nillustrating Jack’s early meeting with the global king of the Internet at\r\nthe time.\r\nJack as Jerry’s tour guide at the Great Wall. Heather Killen\r\nJack; his boss, Xing Wei; Jerry Yang; and Heather Killen in front of a photograph of then\r\nPresident Jiang Zemin. Heather Killen\r\nOn the visit Jack also took Jerry and Heather to meet the vice\r\nminister of MOFTEC. Jack’s charm offensive paid off. In October\r\n1998, Infoshare was appointed the exclusive sales agent for Yahoo in\r\nChina.\r\nBut Jack was already actively planning to slip free of the\r\nconstraints of government. Back at the Great Wall, Jack organized an\r\noff-site meeting with some of his Infoshare colleagues, an outing\r\nsince feted by the company as the unofficial launch of Alibaba. But\r\nJack was worried about the consequences for him and his planned\r\nnew venture of walking out of his government job. A friend advised\r\nJack to feign illness, a common ruse in China to escape from such\r\npredicaments. Jack did in fact come down with appendicitis a few\r\nmonths later, but by then he was already back in Hangzhou and his\r\nnew venture was well under way.\r\nJack and some of the cofounders of Alibaba at the Great Wall of China in late 1998. The\r\ncompany would be launched a few months later. Alibaba\r\nWhat’s in a Name\r\nJack decided to call his new venture Alibaba, a curious name for a\r\nChinese company.\r\nJack has been asked many times why he chose an Arabic name\r\nfor his company rather than something derived from his passion for\r\nChinese martial arts or folklore. Jack was attracted, he said, by the\r\n“open sesame” imagery, since he hoped to achieve an opening for\r\nthe small- and medium-size enterprises he was targeting. He was\r\nalso looking for a name that traveled well, and Alibaba is a name that\r\nis easy to pronounce in many languages. He liked the name since it\r\ncame at the beginning of the alphabet: “Whatever you talk about,\r\nAlibaba is always on top.”\r\nIn China, a song titled “Alibaba Is a Happy Young Man” was\r\npopular at the time, but Jack says the idea came to him4 for the\r\nwebsite on a trip to San Francisco: “I was having lunch, and a\r\nwaitress came. I asked her: ‘Do you know about Alibaba?’ She said,\r\n‘Yes!’ ‘What is Alibaba?’ And she said, ‘Open Sesame.’ So I went\r\ndown to the street and asked about ten to twenty people. They all\r\n[knew] about Alibaba, Forty Thieves, and Open Sesame. I think, this\r\nis a good name.”\r\nBut there was a problem. The domain name alibaba.com was\r\nregistered to a Canadian man who was asking for $4,000 to transfer it\r\nover, a transaction that involved some risk if he didn’t hold up his side\r\nof the bargain. So Jack launched5 the Alibaba site using\r\nalibabaonline.com and alibaba-online.com instead. Alibaba cofounder\r\nLucy Peng recalled how the early team members had joked they\r\nwere working for “AOL,” short for “Alibaba Online.”\r\nJack soon after decided to buy the alibaba.com domain name.6\r\nAlibaba executive vice chairman Joe Tsai later recounted to me that\r\nJack was nervous about wiring funds to the Canadian owner before\r\nhe could be assured of gaining control (a problem that the escrow\r\nfunction of Alipay would later solve): “He didn’t have that kind of\r\nmoney, so was scrounging around. But Jack is a very savvy\r\nbusinessman, he has that innate ability to say, ‘All right, I’m gonna\r\ntrust this guy.’ A lot of entrepreneurs don’t trust other people.” Jack\r\nwent ahead with the wire transfer to the Canadian, who (true to\r\nnational stereotypes) proved honest, and Jack gained control of\r\nalibaba.com.\r\nThe widespread recognition of the Alibaba name has saved Jack\r\na lot of money in marketing expenses and a ready supply of imagery\r\nsuch as the forty thieves, and 1,001 nights, and other elements he\r\nstill often incorporates into his speeches.\r\nLakeside Gardens\r\nAlibaba was launched in Hangzhou by Jack’s friends, supporters, and\r\ncolleagues, including some who joined him from China Pages7 and\r\nInfoshare.\r\nJack convened a meeting on February 21, 1999, at his Lakeside\r\nGardens (Hupan Huayuan) apartment in Hangzhou. Confident in his\r\nfuture success, he arranged for the meeting to be filmed. With the\r\nteam seated around him in a semicircle, some wearing coats to fend\r\noff the damp cold inside the chilly apartment, Jack asked his converts\r\nto ponder the question: “In the next five to ten years, what will Alibaba\r\nbecome?” Answering his own question, he said that “our competitors\r\nare not in China, but in Silicon Valley. . . . We should position Alibaba\r\nas an international website.”\r\nThe reality was that Jack, late to the portal game now dominated\r\nby Sina, Sohu, and NetEase, had to find his own niche in the China\r\nInternet market. The portals were trying to capture the growing\r\nnumber of individual users coming online, but Jack was going to stick\r\nwith what he knew best: small businesses. In contrast to the\r\nbusiness-to-business sites in the United States that were focused on\r\nlarge companies, Jack decided to focus on the “shrimp.” He found\r\ninspiration from his favorite movie, Forrest Gump, in which Gump\r\nmakes a fortune from fishing shrimp after a storm: “American B2B\r\n[business-to-business] sites are whales. But 85 percent of the fish in\r\nthe sea are shrimp-sized. I don’t know anyone who makes money\r\nfrom whales, but I’ve seen many making money from shrimp.”\r\nJack with other cofounders and supporters of Alibaba in the Lakeside Gardens apartment in\r\nHangzhou, October 30, 1999. Alibaba\r\nWhen Jack created Alibaba in early 1999 China had only two\r\nmillion Internet users. But this would double in six months, then\r\ndouble again, reaching nine million by the end of the year. By the\r\nsummer of 2000 there were 17 million online.\r\nPersonal computers still cost a hefty $1,500, but prices began to\r\nfall as new market entrants like Dell set up shop in competition with\r\nhomegrown companies Founder, Great Wall, and Legend (later\r\nrebranded as Lenovo). Sales of new PCs, still going mostly to\r\nbusinesses or government users, hit five million in 1999.\r\nThe government’s policy of “informatization” was making the\r\nInternet more affordable. Getting a connection from the local phone\r\ncompany still took months and could cost as much as $600. But in\r\nMarch 1999 the government scrapped the installation fee for second\r\nphone lines and made it cheaper to surf8 online, too, cutting the\r\naverage price from $70 per month in 1997 to only $9 by the end of\r\n1999.\r\nMillions of young, educated people were coming online at their\r\ncolleges or workplaces, others at the thousands of Internet cafés that\r\nwere mushrooming across the country. Yahoo’s business model in\r\nthe United States was to make money from the growing market for\r\nonline advertising. The three China portals in turn planned to grab a\r\npiece of a fast-growing online advertising cake,9 which grew to $12\r\nmillion in 1999 from only $3 million the year before. But even in the\r\nStates Yahoo was losing money, and in China the bulk of Internet\r\nusers had little disposable income to excite advertisers. The potential\r\nrevenues for the portals were way below their expenditures. Yet in the\r\nupside-down logic of the unfolding dot-com boom, losses were not\r\nonly acceptable but worn as a badge of honor: the bigger the loss,\r\nthe grander a firm’s ambition. Venture capital (VC) firms were there to\r\nbridge the gap.\r\nBefore Alibaba was even out of the starting gate, Sina, Sohu,\r\nand NetEase had started to win the backing of VCs, competing\r\naggressively for new users and investment.\r\nSina10 was formed by the December 1998 merger of Wang\r\nZhidong’s firm SRS with the U.S. company Sinanet, founded by three\r\nTaiwan-born students11 at Stanford University. Daniel Mao, an early\r\ninvestor in SRS at the Walden International Investment Group, helped\r\nbroker the merger. Sina.com was launched in April 1999 and the\r\nfollowing month raised $25 million in VC from investors, including\r\nGoldman Sachs, Walden, and Japan’s SoftBank.\r\nSohu raised $10 million in 1998 and more funding12 the following\r\nyear on the back of soaring traffic on its Chinese-language search\r\nengine. Founder Charles Zhang was relishing his newfound celebrity\r\nstatus in China, and he brought on Stanford-educated returnee Victor\r\nKoo (who later left to found Youku, China’s answer to YouTube) to\r\nbeef up Sohu’s management. He also tried, unsuccessfully, to hire\r\nJack as his COO.\r\nNetEase was the last of the three portals to raise VC funding for\r\nthe simple reason that founder William Ding didn’t really need to: He\r\ncould count on a steady flow of licensing revenues from the webmail\r\nsoftware he had personally developed. William Ding had by far the\r\nhighest equity stake of any portal founder—58.5 percent—when his\r\ncompany went public in 2000.\r\nWatching from the sidelines, Jack realized he would have to\r\nhustle if he was to ever catch the attention of VCs or catch up with\r\nthe portal pioneers who were speeding off into the distance. For\r\nAlibaba to thrive he would have to foster a relentless work ethic,\r\nensuring a clean break from the bureaucratic culture that he and\r\nsome of his colleagues had just left behind in Beijing. Jack exhorted\r\nthe group assembled in his apartment to “learn the hard working spirit\r\nof Silicon Valley . . . If we go to work at 8 A.M. and get off work at 5\r\nP.M., this is not a high-tech company, and Alibaba will never be\r\nsuccessful.”\r\nJack likes to put Silicon Valley companies on a pedestal, but he\r\nalso likes to rally his team by saying Alibaba could knock them off it:\r\n“Americans are strong at hardware and systems but in software and\r\ninformation management, Chinese brains are just as good as\r\nAmerican. . . . I believe that one of us can be worth ten of them.”\r\nAlibaba was formed at a time when the inflating dot-com\r\nvaluations made even his loyal converts nervous about whether the\r\nbubble would soon burst. Speaking to them in his apartment Jack\r\nsought to reassure them: “Has the Internet reached its peak? Have\r\nwe done enough? Is it too late for us to follow? . . . Don’t worry. I don’t\r\nthink the dream of the Internet will burst. We will have to pay a very\r\npainful price in the next three to five years. It is the only way we can\r\nsucceed in the future.” To rally the troops, Jack set a goal of\r\nachieving an IPO within three years. “Once we become a listed\r\ncompany, what each and every one of us will gain . . . is not this\r\napartment, but fifty apartments like this. We are just charging forward.\r\nTeam spirit is very, very important. When we charge forward, even if\r\nwe lose, we still have the team. We still have each other to support.\r\nWhat on earth are you afraid of?”\r\nAlthough Jack and Cathy together were the lead shareholders,\r\nAlibaba was cofounded by a total of eighteen people, six of whom\r\nwere women. None came from privileged backgrounds, prestigious\r\nuniversities,13 or famous companies. This was a team of “regular\r\npeople,” bound together by Jack’s energy and his unconventional\r\nmanagement methods. To build team spirit, Jack drew on his love of\r\nJin Yong’s novels and gave each of his Alibaba team members\r\nnicknames. His own nickname was Feng Qingyang. In Jin Yong’s\r\nbook Swordsman,14 Feng is a reclusive sword and kung fu master,\r\npreparing young apprentices to be heroes. As a former teacher, Jack\r\nidentified with Feng and his “unpredictable yet nurturing”15 character.\r\nJoe Tsai Comes to Hangzhou\r\nIn May 1999, Jack met Joe Tsai,16 a Taiwanese-born investor then\r\nliving in Hong Kong. Joe would become Jack’s right-hand man, a role\r\nhe still performs more than seventeen years later. The association\r\nbetween the two would become one of the most profitable and\r\nenduring partnerships in Chinese business.\r\nJack takes pride in being “one hundred percent Made in China.”\r\nYet, starting with Joe Tsai, a number of “Born in Taiwan” individuals\r\nwould make major contributions to Alibaba’s success, just as they\r\nhave to many technology companies in Silicon Valley.\r\nI first met Joe at the beginning of Alibaba’s journey in 1999,\r\nshortly after he’d joined. In the spring of 2015, I traveled back to\r\nHangzhou to understand what prompted Joe to take such a gamble\r\non Jack. Although the two men were born in the same year, they\r\ncould hardly be more different. Joe came from a prestigious family17\r\nand he had a top-tier academic and professional background.\r\nAt the age of thirteen, speaking hardly any English, Joe was sent\r\noff from Taiwan to the Lawrenceville School, an elite18 boarding\r\nschool in New Jersey. There Joe excelled at his studies as well as at\r\nlacrosse, which he credits with helping him assimilate into American\r\nculture and learn the importance of working in a team: “The sport\r\ntaught me life lessons about teamwork and perseverance. While I\r\nnever got past playing on the third midfield line, being part of the\r\nteam was the best experience of my life.”\r\nJoe won entrance to Yale College, where he studied economics\r\nand East Asian studies, and proceeded on to Yale Law School. After\r\ngraduating he began his career in New York with the storied law firm\r\nSullivan & Cromwell and a short stint at a management buyout firm.\r\nBut Joe wanted to gain investment experience in Asia. He moved to\r\nHong Kong to work for Investor AB, the investment arm of Sweden’s\r\npowerful Wallenberg family. As the dot-com boom gained momentum,\r\nJoe starting looking out for opportunities to team up with an\r\nentrepreneur.\r\nI asked Joe how he came to connect with Jack: “I wanted to be\r\nmore intimately involved in technology start-ups. Because I was\r\nmaking investments for Investor, sitting on boards, I always felt a\r\nlayer of distance between the board and the management. I said to\r\nmyself, I should be involved in the operation.”\r\nJoe first heard about Jack from family friend Jerry Wu, a\r\nTaiwanese businessman who ran a communications start-up. After\r\nJerry came back from Hangzhou he contacted Joe, telling him, “You\r\nhave to go and meet this guy Jack Ma in Hangzhou. He’s kind of\r\ncrazy. He’s got a big vision.”\r\nWu was hoping Alibaba might take over his struggling start-up\r\nand asked Joe for his help.\r\nJoe agreed and hopped on a plane from Hong Kong to\r\nHangzhou to meet Jack in the Lakeside Gardens apartment. “I still\r\ncan remember the first sight of the apartment. It reminded me of my\r\ngrandmother’s apartment in Taipei. When you walked into the\r\nbuilding, the stairway was old and narrow. About ten pairs of shoes\r\nwere in front of the apartment. It was a smelly place. I was in a suit. It\r\nwas May—hot and humid.”\r\nJoe remembers how Jack outlined his ambitious goal for Alibaba:\r\nto help millions of Chinese factories find an outlet overseas for their\r\ngoods. The factory owners lacked the skills to market their products\r\nthemselves and, Jack explained, had little choice but to sell their\r\ngoods through state-owned trading companies. Jack was proposing\r\nto cut out the middleman, always a compelling idea.\r\nJoe was intrigued by Jack as he talked, “sitting backwards in a\r\nchair, clapping, like someone from a kung fu novel.” Listening intently\r\nas Jack switched effortlessly in and out of fluent English. Joe was\r\nimpressed. This guy is good! he thought to himself.\r\nWhen Jack spoke Mandarin he did so in an accent that reminded\r\nJoe of his own grandfather, whose ancestral home was in Huzhou,\r\nnear Hangzhou.19 Speaking in Mandarin, Joe had started the\r\nconversation by apologizing to Jack that he couldn’t speak the\r\nHangzhou dialect. Thinking that it might help establish a rapport, Joe\r\nadded, “I do speak Shanghainese. My parents grew up in Shanghai.”\r\nLooking back on that first meeting, Joe laughs. “I hadn’t realized that\r\nHangzhou people hated Shanghainese. They think they are too sly,\r\ntoo commercial, too money-oriented. Later on Jack told me that there\r\nare three kinds of people he doesn’t trust: Shanghainese, Taiwanese,\r\nand Hong Kong people.” But somehow Jack and Joe, a\r\nShanghainese-speaking Taiwanese who lived in Hong Kong, hit it off.\r\n“It was fate that the two of us ended up working together.”\r\nJoe flew back to Hong Kong and shared his excitement about\r\nJack and Alibaba with his wife, Clara. But trading a well-paying job in\r\nHong Kong for a start-up in Hangzhou was a big risk, especially since\r\nClara20 was expecting their first child. So Clara suggested she travel\r\nwith Joe back to Hangzhou.\r\nJack remembers their visit. Clara told him she wanted to see\r\nAlibaba because her husband was crazy about it: “If I agree with him,\r\nthen I am crazy. But if I don’t agree, he will hate me his whole life.”\r\nJoe too was thinking carefully before taking the plunge. “I went\r\nback a second time because I saw something in Jack. Not just the\r\nvision, the sparks in his eyes. But a team of people, his loyal\r\nfollowers. They believed in the vision. I said to myself, If I am going to\r\njoin a group of people, this is the one. There is a clear leader, the\r\nglue to the whole thing. I just felt a real affinity to Jack. I mean who\r\nwouldn’t?”\r\nJack struck Joe as being very different from other entrepreneurs\r\nhe’d met or read about, telling Joe that “[t]o him, friends are as\r\nimportant as family. His definition of friends includes colleagues.\r\nWhen you try to compare [Jack] with, say, Steve Jobs, they are\r\ndifferent people, different to the core.”\r\nJoe liked the fact that Jack was open about his own\r\nshortcomings. “I think me coming into the scene was very novel. I’m\r\nthe guy who knew finance. I was a lawyer before. I could help\r\nincorporate a company and I could help raise capital. So immediately\r\nfrom day one, I think we built a bond.”\r\nWhen I first met Joe, I found him very calm and reserved, in\r\nmany ways the polar opposite of Jack’s exuberance and\r\nunpredictability. As I spent more time working with them, I came to\r\nappreciate how Joe’s professionalism in, say, carefully drafting a\r\ncontract created the structure for Alibaba to harness Jack’s energy\r\nand enthusiasm. Another China Internet founder I spoke to agreed,\r\n“In the early days, especially, Joe kept Jack in check.”\r\nJoe is self-effacing about his role at the company. When I asked\r\nhim whether he considered himself Jack’s “consigliere,” he told me he\r\nprefers to think of himself as Jack’s interpreter: “Jack is very smart.\r\nBut Jack sometimes says things that people misinterpret, so I am\r\nthere to explain things.”\r\nJack is effusive in his praise of Joe, often saluting him for the risk\r\nhe took on joining Alibaba back in 1999. To an audience a few years\r\nago in Taipei, Jack said, “How many would give up a well-paying job\r\nlike him?” He added, “This is courage. This is action. This is the real\r\ndream.”\r\nJoe did take a gamble back in 1999, but it wasn’t a blind bet. Joe\r\nwas able to increase his chances of backing a winner by first getting\r\nthe company ready to raise capital, then taking the lead in finding its\r\nfirst investor.\r\nJoe told his boss at Investor AB, where he would keep his job for\r\nnow,21 that he would spend his personal time helping an entrepreneur\r\nhe had met in China.\r\nJoe got to work sorting out the paperwork at Alibaba. As with\r\nmany start-ups, it was a bit of a mess. “When I got to Hangzhou Jack\r\ndidn’t even have a company. He hadn’t incorporated anything yet. It\r\nwas just a website.”\r\nJoe’s first task was to document Alibaba’s shareholders: “I called\r\nhim up and said, ‘Jack, I’m incorporating the company. Who are the\r\nshareholders?’ He faxed me a list of the names. My jaw dropped,\r\nbecause every single one of those kids in the apartment was on the\r\nlist, as a shareholder. So from day one, he gave away quite a lot [of\r\nequity].” But as Joe looked through the eighteen names22 he realized\r\nthat “everybody was a crucial part of the team, whether an engineer\r\nor in customer service.” He laughed as he recalled the nickname\r\nPotato for cofounder Lucy Peng, which she used when answering\r\nemails sent from Alibaba’s Western customers.\r\nNext he wanted to get an understanding of Alibaba’s customers.\r\nHe asked the team how many there were. When told there were\r\ntwenty-eight thousand, Joe replied, “Wow, that’s a big number!” Yet\r\nall of the customer information was being stored manually, each one\r\non a piece of paper stuffed into a book with all the others.\r\nAlibaba wasn’t generating any revenue and urgently need to\r\nraise capital. “Of course at that time no capital was available in China.\r\nIt was all American.” Looking at how Sina, Sohu, and NetEase had\r\ndone it, Joe registered an offshore company,23 writing out a personal\r\ncheck for $20,000 to a law firm, Fenwick & West, to ready Alibaba’s\r\ncorporate structure to receive venture capital investment. All they\r\nneeded now was to find the investors. He set out with Jack for San\r\nFrancisco.24\r\nOn arrival, they checked into a cheap hotel off Union Square,\r\nthen headed down the next morning to Palo Alto to meet some VCs.\r\nThe meetings did not go well. Joe recalls being peppered with\r\nquestions: “What are you trying to do? What’s your business model?”\r\nBut they didn’t even have a pitch book. “I had tried to prepare\r\nsomething, like a business plan.” But Jack said he didn’t do business\r\nplans, telling Joe, “I just want to go and meet people, and talk to them\r\nabout it.”\r\nThe trip was a failure, although they did have one promising lead\r\nfrom a breakfast meeting in Palo Alto with a Singapore-based\r\ninvestor, Thomas Ng, of Venture TDF. The VCs weren’t really\r\ninterested in business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, which seemed\r\ndull compared to the excitement surrounding Yahoo, which Sina,\r\nSohu, and NetEase were all able to tap into. There were a couple of\r\nB2B examples that raised venture money—Ariba.com and\r\nCommerce One—but they were U.S. based and served a much more\r\nmature market than Alibaba.\r\nOther emerging China e-commerce players were beginning to\r\nhave some success at fund-raising. One was a consumer ecommerce\r\nventure called 8848.net.25 Launched in April 1999 and\r\nmodeling its business on Amazon, 8848 sold books, software,\r\nelectronics, and other local items, such as IP phone calling cards that\r\nwere popular at the time. It had a well-established backer in forty-sixyear-\r\nold Charles Xue (Xue Biqun). Xue had studied at UC Berkeley at\r\nthe same time as SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son. The chairman of\r\n8848, Wang Juntao, enjoyed a higher profile in China media circles\r\nthan Jack. NetEase too was experimenting with consumer ecommerce,\r\nholding one of China’s first online auctions in July 1999\r\nwhen the site sold 100 PCs for a total of $150,000. Another new\r\nbusiness, modeled on eBay, was also emerging: the Shanghai-based\r\nfirm EachNet, led by a brilliant young Harvard-educated returnee,\r\nShao Yibo, also known as Bo Shao.\r\nYet Jack was convinced that as the largest supplier of laborintensive\r\ncommodities to the world, China was ready for B2B ecommerce.\r\nBut other entrepreneurs had come to the same\r\nconclusion. A California-based company had launched a B2B website\r\ncalled MeetChina.com and secured the backing of the venture capital\r\nfirm IDG. In the coming year or so, MeetChina.com would raise more\r\nthan $40 million in venture capital, significantly more than Alibaba.\r\nMeetChina would also excel at courting the support of governments\r\non both sides of the Pacific.\r\nIn Beijing, MeetChina.com’s founders claimed a special\r\nrelationship26 with the powerful Ministry of Information Industry. At its\r\nApril 1999 launch, the company promoted itself as “China’s first major\r\ngovernment-sponsored business-to-business Internet portal.”\r\nCofounder Kenneth Leonard talked up his ties in Washington, D.C.,\r\nclaiming a business relationship with Neil Bush, the younger brother\r\nof George W. and Jeb Bush, and securing an invitation to the White\r\nHouse and publicity for the company’s Asia-wide e-commerce push\r\nby signing an agreement in Vietnam during Bill and Hillary Clinton’s\r\ngroundbreaking presidential visit to the country the following year.\r\nMeetChina was good at PR in China, too. One of its cofounders,\r\nTom Rosenthal, told the Wall Street Journal, “We’ve got the services\r\nto make buying from China as easy as buying from a local hardware\r\nstore.” In the following months, MeetChina opened nine offices and\r\nhired more than 250 staff across China, signing impressive-sounding\r\npartnerships with a raft of companies including Dun & Bradstreet and\r\nWestern Union.\r\nB2B websites backed by Chinese government agencies were\r\nstepping up their efforts, too, including chinamarket.com, which Jack\r\nhad helped set up. Watching the traction Alibaba was gaining with\r\ncompanies in Zhejiang Province, neighboring Jiangsu Province\r\nlaunched its own website—Made-in-China.com—as well.\r\nBut having just escaped the clutches of government, Jack was\r\nconvinced that his customer-first approach would prevail over other\r\nwebsites that focused foremost on wining and dining government\r\nofficials.\r\nNone of these sites would end up being Alibaba’s main\r\ncompetitor. Instead Jack’s biggest rival was not even a “new\r\neconomy” company at all. It was an old-school publisher of trade\r\nmagazines.\r\nGlobal Sources had been around for more than three decades.\r\nThe company was run by its founder, Merle Hinrichs. A reclusive\r\nAmerican whose base of operations was his 160-foot yacht anchored\r\nin the Philippines, Hinrichs was a native of Hastings, Nebraska, but\r\nhad been a resident of Asia since 1965. He had built up his company,\r\noriginally known as Asian Sources Media Group, by churning out\r\nthick trade catalogs stuffed with advertisements from manufacturers\r\nin Asia of electronics, computer products, watches, toys, and sporting\r\ngoods. Sent to buyers such as Walmart, the magazine generated\r\nhundreds of millions of dollars of orders per year.\r\nReluctant to cannibalize its profitable offline business, Global\r\nSources was nervous about building a presence on the Web. Hinrichs\r\nwas dismissive of B2B sites: “Suppliers and buyers were happy with\r\nthe fax machine as that was cheap and simple to use.”\r\nBut as Internet access spread, companies like Alibaba had an\r\nopportunity to pitch themselves as the new face of Asian business.\r\nAlthough Alibaba was struggling to convince investors to back it, the\r\ncompany started to have more success with the media, all thanks to\r\nJack’s charisma and gift of gab.\r\nOn April 17, 1999, The Economist ran an article titled “Asia\r\nOnline.” Its lead sentence consisted of the prophetic statement that\r\n“America has Jeff Bezos, China has [Jack] Ma Yun.” Joe read that\r\narticle on his flight up to Hangzhou to meet Jack, further piquing his\r\ninterest in Alibaba.\r\nThe article was written by Chris Anderson, then based in Hong\r\nKong. I contacted him to ask him what prompted him to write about\r\nJack in such glowing terms. After more than a decade as editor in\r\nchief of Wired magazine, Chris lives today in Berkeley, California,\r\nwhere he is the cofounder and CEO of 3D Robotics, a drone\r\nmanufacturing company.27 Chris recalled his first meeting with Jack in\r\nearly 1999 in Hong Kong. “Jack came to see me with what was then\r\nan idea for Alibaba. I thought it was a great business but a terrible\r\nname. Needless to say, he didn’t take my advice, but we’ve remained\r\nfriends since.”\r\nChris explained to me that in his Economist article he had\r\ncompared Jack to Jeff Bezos because “[b]oth are clever\r\nentrepreneurs who have grown rich by being among the first to\r\nexploit the Internet’s potential. But there the similarities end.” Of\r\ncourse, Jack wouldn’t become truly rich for many years yet, but the\r\nfact that Chris had been impressed by his infectious enthusiasm is an\r\nearly example of how “Jack Magic” has played a key role in Alibaba’s\r\nrise.\r\nChinadotcom\r\nBut unbeknownst to Jack and Joe as they headed empty-handed\r\nfrom Silicon Valley back to Asia, their fortunes were about to be\r\ntransformed thanks to an event that signaled the beginning of the\r\nChina Internet gold rush: the Nasdaq IPO of China.com.\r\nChina.com, operated by the company Chinadotcom, part of\r\nChina Internet Corporation (CIC), was led by a deal maker in Hong\r\nKong called Peter Yip. Yip was an unlikely candidate for a China\r\nInternet entrepreneur. He wasn’t from China—born in Singapore,28 he\r\nwas based in Hong Kong—and was a decade or so older than Jack\r\nand the portal founders; few people in China had ever heard of him or\r\nhis website.\r\nBut just as dot-com investing began to reach a fever pitch in the\r\nUnited States, CIC found itself sitting on some very important\r\nassets:29 the domain names china.com, hongkong.com, and\r\ntaiwan.com. Using these as leverage, Yip signed on some influential\r\nbackers, including the unlikely bedfellows America Online and\r\nXinhua, China’s state news agency. To AOL he offered his services\r\nas a gatekeeper to the China market. To Xinhua he promised to build\r\na “walled garden” of content, filtering out undesirable content on the\r\nInternet.\r\nYip called his vision the “China Wide Web.” In a speech at\r\nHarvard University, he argued that much of the content on the\r\nInternet was “not relevant to most Chinese.” Touting the Xinhua\r\nbacking, he claimed30 that the Chinese government had established\r\nan Internet strategy and “asked me to help them create a vehicle to\r\nallow people to participate.” The news area of his china.com website\r\ncarried the terrifying tagline “We do the surfing for you.” But Chinese\r\nusers wanted access to the full Internet, something that local\r\nentrepreneurs such as the three portal pioneers were working hard to\r\nenable. Yip’s efforts failed to gain traction with Internet users in\r\nChina. His “know who” approach, based on relationships, was beaten\r\nout by the “know how” smarts of China’s new generation of techsavvy\r\nInternet entrepreneurs.\r\nBut Peter Yip beat out his mainland Chinese rivals in one\r\nimportant aspect: He really knew how to raise money, scoring a $34\r\nmillion investment in china.com from AOL, then in July 1999 an IPO\r\nfor the company on the Nasdaq.\r\nPeople working in China’s Internet sector were fiercely critical of\r\nthe company and its claims. I was one of them, telling the New York\r\nTimes that China.com was “out of step with what Internet users in\r\nChina are about,” and that “companies that make deals with them are\r\nactually doing themselves a disservice.” In June 1999 I wrote a report\r\nwarning that if China.com was to IPO before the “real” Chinese\r\nportals it would “represent the triumph of form over substance and\r\neffectively spoil the market for mainland Chinese Internet companies.”\r\nHow wrong I was. Instead of extinguishing the opportunity for China\r\ntech IPOs, China.com lit the market on fire.\r\nOn July 13, 1999, China.com listed its shares on the Nasdaq.\r\nThe stock ticker for the company was as catchy as its website:\r\n“CHINA.” Listing at $20, the stock closed that day at $67. What’s in a\r\nname? In the case of China.com, a company that people in China\r\nhad hardly ever heard of, the answer was $84 million—the amount\r\nthe company raised in the IPO, to which the company added a thenmassive\r\n$400 million the following February in a secondary offering,\r\nvaluing the company at $5 billion. The company raised so much\r\nmoney that it would be eleven years before it finally slipped into\r\nbankruptcy.\r\nThe shock waves from China.com’s July 1999 IPO reverberated\r\nacross the mainland’s nascent tech community. How had a guy with a\r\nwebsite that almost no one had heard of raised so much money\r\novernight? The IPO unleashed a frenzy of investments and deal\r\nmaking as entrepreneurs across the country concluded, “If China.com\r\ncan do it, so can I!”\r\nChapter Seven\r\nBackers: Goldman and SoftBank\r\nThe Internet [is like] beer . . . the good stuff is at the bottom. Without\r\nthe bubbles, the beer is flat and nobody would want to drink it.\r\n—Jack Ma\r\nOn its first day of trading on the Nasdaq, China.com—a company\r\nwith only $4 million in annual revenues, on which it had lost $9 million\r\n—closed the day worth $1.6 billion. Peter Yip had listed only a small\r\nnumber of shares, so investors cast around looking for other China\r\nInternet stocks to buy. The problem was, there weren’t any.\r\nSeizing the opportunity, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs\r\nleapt into action. In Hong Kong there was a sudden explosion of tech\r\ngatherings, speed-dating exercises between young entrepreneurs\r\nand the investors that wanted to back them. One of the largest meetups\r\nwas called “I&I,” short for “Internet & Information Asia.” The event\r\nhad been around for a while, typically with a few people gathering\r\naround a table in one of the tiny bars of Lan Kwai Fong, just up the\r\nhill from the city’s main central business district. But the China.com\r\nIPO changed all that. Suddenly hundreds of people showed up at I&I,\r\nthe venues switching to five-star hotels like the Ritz-Carlton as banks\r\nand law firms tripped over one another for the right to sponsor the\r\nchampagne and hors d’oeuvres. Hong Kong was ready to package\r\nthe deals, but the market and the entrepreneurs to build the\r\ncompanies were across the border in mainland China. Suddenly\r\nBeijing and Shanghai were awash in deal makers. The China Internet\r\nbubble had officially begun and new dot-com ventures started to\r\nsprout up like weeds. Alibaba would have to fight for its share of\r\nsunlight.\r\nMedia Coverage\r\nBefore even the VCs had showed up, foreign media arrived to cover\r\nthe China Internet story. Jack became a regular fixture at tech and\r\ninvestor conferences around the country, his comments so quotable\r\nthat the Los Angeles Times called him a “sound-bite machine.”\r\nSoon after the China.com IPO, a BusinessWeek magazine cover\r\nstory named Jack one of “China’s Web Masters.” Alibaba had yet to\r\ngenerate meaningful revenues but BusinessWeek predicted that\r\ninvesting in B2B e-commerce could mean an even bigger payoff than\r\ninvesting in China’s three portals.\r\nOn August 31, 1999, an article written by my colleague Ted Dean\r\nappeared in Hong Kong’s leading English-language daily, the South\r\nChina Morning Post.1 Ted had first met Jack a year or so earlier when\r\nJack was still working for the government. In the article, Ted predicted\r\nthat Alibaba “may turn out to be a global powerhouse” in B2B ecommerce.\r\nJack laid out his ambition: “We don’t want to be number\r\none in China. We want to be number one in the world.”\r\nIn our small investment consultancy, we were hearing a lot of\r\nthose kinds of statements and were already becoming a bit cynical\r\nabout the dot-com boom. But after interviewing Jack for the article in\r\nHangzhou a few days earlier, Ted told me there was something about\r\nJack that was different. I knew I had to meet him.\r\nWhen Jack invited me to visit, I hopped on a train from Shanghai\r\nto Hangzhou. I booked myself back into the Shangri-La Hotel, the\r\nsame hotel where Jack as a boy had first approached David Morley\r\nto practice his English. After checking in I took a taxi over to the\r\nLakeside Gardens apartment.\r\nI was immediately struck by Jack’s infectious enthusiasm and\r\ncapacity to charm, influenced no doubt by growing up in a household\r\nwhere both his parents practiced pingtan, the traditional art form that\r\nincludes comedic routines.\r\nIn his article, Ted had quoted Jack saying, “If you plan, you lose.\r\nIf you don’t plan, you win.” After working in Beijing, the land of the\r\nfive-year plan, I found Jack’s spontaneity refreshing. Foreign\r\nprofessionals2 began to enter Jack’s orbit, giving Alibaba an\r\ninternational flavor within months of its founding. Alibaba also had a\r\nstrong component of female executives,3 adding to the achievement\r\nof women making up one third of its founding team—in contrast to\r\nmany Silicon Valley–based companies.\r\nGoldman Invests\r\nMeanwhile, in Hong Kong, shortly after their unsuccessful fundraising\r\ntrip to Silicon Valley, Joe had started negotiations with\r\nTranspac, a Singapore-based fund, about investing in Alibaba. Soon\r\nthey had agreed to a term sheet that would value Alibaba at $7\r\nmillion.4 But Transpac insisted on an onerous provision5 and Joe\r\nwanted to walk away.\r\nHe then called up a friend at Goldman Sachs. Like Joe, Shirley\r\nLin was born in Taiwan and educated in the United States. The two\r\nhad met a decade earlier. For Alibaba it would prove to have been a\r\nfateful encounter.\r\nIn the summer of 2015, I met up with Shirley in New York to talk\r\nabout Goldman Sachs’s transformative investment in Alibaba in 1999.\r\nShirley and I have known each other since 1999. We had been\r\nclassmates at Morgan Stanley, the investment bank we joined fresh\r\nout of college. While I stayed on at Morgan Stanley, Shirley had left\r\nafter a few years for Goldman Sachs to start making investments in\r\ntechnology and Internet companies across Asia.\r\nTen years before the Alibaba deal, Shirley and Joe had met by\r\nchance on a long plane ride from Taipei to New York. “I was going\r\nback to Harvard, he was going back to Yale. We were seated\r\nadjacent to each other.” She remembers Joe’s face was buried for\r\nmost of the trip in a book on constitutional law. He remembers Shirley\r\nintently reading the Wall Street Journal, cover to cover. After a while\r\nthey struck up a conversation. Contemplating the books and exams\r\nthat awaited them back at college, “pretty soon we were both\r\nlamenting each other’s fate,” Shirley told me.\r\nAs Jack and Joe had already discovered, there weren’t many\r\ninvestment firms in Asia with much experience in technology\r\ncompanies. In 1999, Shirley was already busily placing bets6 on\r\nChina Internet companies, ultimately investing in all three portals.\r\nGoldman invested directly in Sina and NetEase, and indirectly in\r\nSohu.7\r\nGoldman had given Shirley and her team a lot of leeway,\r\nprovided she kept the investments below $5 million. This was\r\npeanuts to Goldman, whose Principal Investment Area (PIA) unit\r\nwould make $1 billion in investments in tech companies from 1995 to\r\n2000, one-quarter in companies based in Asia.\r\nWith so few funds already on the ground in Asia, Shirley was\r\nbombarded with requests for investment from her Harvard\r\nclassmates and other friends pursuing the new wave of dot-com\r\nriches. The quality of the business plans was pretty low, often simple\r\ncopy-and-paste jobs. Shirley and her team worked around the clock,\r\nwading through stacks of pitch documents, investing, she estimates,\r\nin less than one in a thousand.\r\nWhile the easy route was to invest in companies with at least one\r\nknown quantity—founders who were classmates or friends—for the\r\nChina Internet story Shirley had a strong preference in finding\r\nhomegrown talent. “I really thought that to invest in China, you have\r\nto know the local market.”\r\nBut scouring through China start-ups had its drawbacks.\r\nTraveling on unpaved roads in provincial cities, Shirley felt more like a\r\nloan officer with the Asian Development Bank than an investment\r\nbanker. She also had a hard time being taken seriously: “Even though\r\nwe were at Goldman, people in China didn’t know who we were. They\r\nasked, ‘Are you Mrs. Goldman? Are you married to the owner of this\r\nbusiness?’ They thought Goldman and Sachs were two people who\r\nowned the company, and I must be married to one of them.”\r\nSo when Joe Tsai approached her about a start-up run by a local\r\nentrepreneur in Hangzhou, she was interested, particularly when he\r\ntold her he planned to join the company. Shirley decided to fly up\r\nfrom Hong Kong to Hangzhou to meet Jack in late September 1999.\r\nJack, she recalled, was “as local as it gets.”\r\n“I went up to the apartment, where they were all working twentyfour/\r\nseven. . . . The whole place stank. Jack’s ideas were not entirely\r\noriginal—they had been tried in other countries. But he was\r\ncompletely dedicated to making them work in China. I was moved by\r\nwhat I saw.”\r\nAs with Joe before her, Shirley was less impressed by the\r\nbusiness itself than by the team, the real reason she would decide to\r\ninvest: Who were they? What was their history? Knowing Joe\r\nchecked one box. Seeing Jack and the team in action checked\r\nanother. “Really, it was all about Jack and his people.” Shirley\r\nremembers being impressed by how hard Jack’s wife, Cathy, was\r\nworking. She and Jack toiled away, she recalled, like “revolutionary\r\ncomrades.”\r\nAlibaba had been approached by other investors, but Shirley\r\nknew that the backing of Goldman would make all the difference for\r\nan unknown start-up in China. They discussed the investment over\r\ntea. If Goldman invested, she told Jack and Joe, she would\r\npersonally ensure Alibaba was known to the world. With B2B\r\ncompetitors like MeetChina waiting in the wings and actively fundraising,\r\nthe offer proved too tempting to resist. Shirley negotiated to\r\nacquire a majority stake in Alibaba for $5 million. She headed back to\r\nHong Kong, where her colleagues Paul Yang and Oliver Weisberg8\r\ndrew up the term sheet for the investment.\r\nThe following weekend Shirley was swimming with her family at\r\nthe Repulse Bay beach on the south side of Hong Kong Island when\r\nher cell phone rang. It was Jack. He really wanted to do the deal but\r\nasked Shirley to leave him more equity. If Goldman took a controlling\r\nstake in his company, he explained, he couldn’t feel like a true\r\nentrepreneur. Jack told her how he’d put everything into the venture.\r\n“This is my life,” he said. Shirley replied, “What do you mean this is\r\nyour life, you’ve only just started?” Jack explained, “But this is my\r\nthird venture already.” Jack finally convinced her. The term sheet for\r\nthe investment had been drawn up, but there were brackets around\r\nthe numbers so it would be an easy change. Goldman would invest\r\nthe $5 million for 500,000 shares, half the company, while retaining\r\nveto rights over key decisions.\r\nJust after she had agreed to the new terms, mid-conversation\r\nwith Jack, she accidentally dropped her cell phone into the sea.\r\nOops, she thought to herself. Well, I guess there goes $5 million.\r\nJack had succeeded in securing a big-name investor in what\r\nwould prove a critical step in Alibaba’s story. But he would also come\r\nto regret selling such a large stake in the company, 50 percent, which\r\nhe would never recoup. In reality, though, Jack had little choice. He\r\nwas an unproven entrepreneur based in a provincial city in China who\r\nwas negotiating with a huge, global financial institution. But having\r\nalready given out a lot of equity to his cofounders and now 50 percent\r\nto investors, he ended up with a much lower share of his company\r\nthan many of his peers. Jack would later joke, only half-kidding, that it\r\nwas the “worst deal I ever made.”\r\nWhen Shirley took the deal to her investment committee, which\r\noversaw all the fund’s investments, she encountered an unexpected\r\nsnag. They pushed back. If Goldman invested the full $5 million, the\r\nfund would need to gain the approval of their investors. “Please get\r\nrid of some,” they told her. So, Shirley reduced Goldman’s stake to 33\r\npercent. Now she quickly had to find investors for the other 17\r\npercent.\r\nToday the thought of having to cast urgently around for buyers\r\nwilling to pay $1.7 million for a 17 percent stake in Alibaba, now worth\r\ntens of billions of dollars, is laughable. In the end she brought in\r\nThomas Ng of Venture TDF, who had met Jack and Joe that summer\r\nin Palo Alto, for half a million dollars. Fidelity Growth Partners Asia\r\ncame in for another half a million. Joe had already told his employer\r\nthat he was going to join a start-up in China. When Joe informed his\r\nboss, Galeazzo Scarampi, that he had found investors and was going\r\nto leave to join Alibaba, Investor AB also came in for a slice.\r\nTranspac rounded out the balance of the $1.7 million investment\r\nalongside Goldman’s $3.3 million.\r\nSome of the investors, including Venture TDF and Fidelity, held\r\non to their stakes all the way through Alibaba’s 2014 IPO, generating\r\nreturns of billions of dollars.\r\nWhen the Goldman-led round was finalized on October 27, 1999,\r\nthe investment cemented Joe’s authority as Jack’s right-hand man.\r\nThe $5 million round led by Goldman was a start, but peanuts\r\ncompared to the war chest of the three China portals, who were\r\nbesieged by eager investors as the Nasdaq began its vertiginous\r\nclimb, gaining 80 percent in eight months, valuing its component\r\ncompanies at $6.7 trillion in early 2000.\r\nAll eyes were on the companies who positioned themselves as\r\nthe Yahoo of China, as well as the moves of Yahoo itself in China. In\r\nSeptember 1999, Yahoo, then valued at $36 billion, announced a\r\npartnership with Founder, the largest local PC manufacturer at the\r\ntime, targeting the mainland.9 At the same time, Sohu, Sina, and\r\nNetEase ramped up their fund-raising.\r\nSina would raise the most, including $60 million in November\r\n1999 from investors, including Goldman Sachs and SoftBank, putting\r\nthe company in pole position for an IPO in the United States. Sohu\r\nraised $30 million, its founder Charles Zhang capturing the mood of\r\nthe day: “This is a game of spending money and how fast you can\r\nspend money.” Even William Ding at NetEase relented, raising in two\r\nrounds $20 million from investors, including Goldman Sachs, but not\r\nwithout venting his frustration that now “people never ask you about\r\nyour new products. . . . They only ask you, ‘When is your IPO?’”\r\nOn October 7 Alibaba tried to grab some of the limelight with a\r\npress conference in Hong Kong to announce a new version of its\r\nwebsite and disclosing that it was open to an IPO in the United States\r\nor on the planned “second board” of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,\r\nthe Growth Enterprise Market.\r\nCaught up in the excitement of Hong Kong, Alibaba also\r\nannounced that it would move its headquarters there from Hangzhou.\r\nJack had been spending most of his time in Hong Kong, working with\r\nJoe and some new recruits out of a conference room in Goldman’s\r\noffice. The contrast couldn’t have been greater between Alibaba’s\r\nhumble, second-floor Lakeside Gardens apartment in Hangzhou and\r\nits new perch atop the gleaming Citibank Plaza skyscraper with\r\nbreathtaking views over Victoria Harbor.\r\nTo support Goldman’s newest portfolio company, Shirley Lin\r\nconducted a series of interviews with media in Hong Kong, even\r\ngoing on local television stations to spread the word about Alibaba.\r\n“My Cantonese was so bad back then they had to subtitle me,” she\r\nrecalls.\r\nWhen Goldman moved to even shinier new offices atop\r\nbillionaire Li Ka-shing’s brand-new Cheung Kong Center, Alibaba\r\nsigned a lease on its own impressive (and expensive) new space, the\r\nfirst major outlay from Goldman’s $5 million that had hit the bank.\r\nAlibaba could get down to business.\r\nIts business was simple: to become the leading website in China\r\nfor business-to-business leads. To match buyers with sellers, Alibaba\r\norganized its members’ postings into twenty-seven industry sectors,\r\nsuch as “Apparel & Fashion,” “Electronics and Electrical,” and\r\n“Industrial Supplies.” Users could sign up for free to receive\r\nnotification of trade deals, and search for offers to buy or sell within a\r\nsector or a geographical area. By October 1999, Alibaba had signed\r\nup more than forty thousand users. Now it had to go for a much\r\nhigher quantity of users, while maintaining the quality of the\r\nmessages tacked onto its virtual bulletin board.\r\nMost of the sellers on its site were export or trading companies in\r\nChina, including a strong representation of firms led by Zhejiang\r\nentrepreneurs. The Internet was still new for many of these firms, but\r\nthey quickly became loyal users of Alibaba.com. Many lacked the\r\nscale or connections needed to trade through the state-owned trading\r\ncompanies, and some were located in remote areas that made\r\ntraveling to trade shows like the Canton Fair too expensive. Having\r\ngrown up among them and served them as clients of Hope\r\nTranslation and China Pages, Jack had a keen sense of what these\r\nsmall firms needed: “Most SMEs [small and medium enterprises]\r\nhave a very changeable dynamic. Today they might sell T-shirts,\r\ntomorrow it could be chemicals.”\r\nTo attract buyers, Alibaba needed to ensure vendors’ listings\r\nwere translated accurately into English. Drawing on the talent pool of\r\nuniversity graduates in Hangzhou, Alibaba started to hire Englishspeaking\r\neditors to ensure that the posts on the bulletin board were\r\ncomplete, intelligible, and properly categorized. Leveraging his\r\ncontacts from MOFTEC in Beijing, Jack also hired recruits with trade\r\nknow-how to make the website attractive to foreign buyers.\r\nPosting on the site, for buyers and sellers, was free—a central\r\ntenet of Jack’s approach throughout his career. His “if you build it,\r\nthey will come” approach helped him pull clear of any rivals. If visitors\r\nto Alibaba.com were able to make new trade leads, he figured, they\r\nwould demonstrate increasing loyalty, or “stickiness” to the website.\r\nBut while free was great for users, it was a tough business\r\nmodel. Alibaba was vulnerable to any downtime in the Internet\r\nfunding frenzy. Also, as traffic grew dramatically on Alibaba’s website,\r\nmaintaining the quality of postings was a big job. If Alibaba wasn’t\r\ncareful it could be overwhelmed. Another challenge was the\r\nincreasing competition for talent. In the dot-com boom, skilled\r\nemployees constantly jumped ship to rival ventures or, tapping the\r\ngrowing pool of venture funding, tried their luck at their own start-ups.\r\nThe cost of talent started to spiral upward, including for the software\r\ndevelopers, Web designers, and project managers that Alibaba would\r\nneed to build out its offerings.\r\nHere Alibaba had two important things going for it: Hangzhou\r\nand Jack Ma. Unlike Beijing and Shanghai, where turnover of\r\nqualified employees was a major headache for entrepreneurs,\r\nHangzhou had a deep pool of fresh graduates and very few local\r\nemployers. In addition, Alibaba benefited from Hangzhou’s relative\r\nisolation. There weren’t really any rivals to poach his employees. A\r\nfew other technology firms were located in the town, such as\r\nUTStarcom or Eastcom, but in the dot-com craze these were fast\r\nbecoming “old economy” ventures. Alibaba also benefited from\r\nHangzhou’s distance from Shanghai—then some two hours away.\r\nFor young talented engineers in Hangzhou who wanted to work for a\r\nfast-growing Internet venture, Alibaba was it.\r\nThis helped keep costs low, too. For the price of one engineer in\r\nBeijing or Shanghai, Alibaba could hire two. The comparison with\r\nSilicon Valley was even more dramatic, as Jack pointed out: “[To]\r\nkeep one programmer happy [in Silicon Valley] takes $50,000 to\r\n$100,000. For that much money in China, I can keep ten very smart\r\npeople happy all the time.”\r\nAs a “second tier” city real estate was cheaper in Hangzhou, too.\r\nEven after Alibaba moved into a 200,000-square-foot office in early\r\n2000, its total rental bill was just $80,000 a year, a fraction of what it\r\nwould have been in Beijing or Shanghai. Jack liked the distance from\r\nBeijing: “Even though the infrastructure is not as good as in\r\nShanghai, it’s better to be as far away from the central government as\r\npossible.”\r\nAli People\r\nWhen building up his team Jack preferred hiring people a notch or\r\ntwo below the top performers in their schools. The college elite, Jack\r\nexplained, would easily get frustrated when they encountered the\r\ndifficulties of the real world. For those who came aboard, working for\r\nAlibaba would be no picnic. The pay was low: The earliest hires\r\nearned barely $50 per month. They worked seven days a week, often\r\nsixteen hours a day. Jack even required them to find a place to live\r\nno more than ten minutes from the office so they wouldn’t waste\r\nprecious time commuting.\r\nFrom the outset, Alibaba has been driven by a Silicon Valley–\r\nstyle work ethic, with every employee issued share options in the\r\ncompany, vesting over a four-year period. This is still a rarity in China,\r\nwhere the traditional setup in private companies was an emperor-like\r\nboss who treated employees as disposable and salaries as\r\ndiscretionary.\r\nAs the Alibaba.com website grew in popularity—aided by offering\r\nits services for free—the team in Hangzhou struggled to keep up with\r\nthe volume of incoming emails. Alibaba’s customer service team\r\nfound themselves at times acting as free tech support to clients,\r\nresponding to questions about how to reboot a computer. But wedded\r\nto its “customer first” tenet, Alibaba resolved to respond to every\r\nemail within two hours.\r\nKeeping the team focused, cofounder Simon Xie recalled, Jack\r\nwas “a culture, a nucleus.” Jack greeted new recruits with a sobering\r\nmessage, and a promise:10 Then trotting out one of his favorite\r\nsayings: “Today is brutal, tomorrow is more brutal, but the day after\r\ntomorrow is beautiful. However, the majority of people will die\r\ntomorrow night. They won’t be able to see the sunshine the day after\r\ntomorrow. Aliren11 must see the sunshine the day after tomorrow.”\r\nCofounder Lucy Peng, Alibaba’s first human resources director\r\nand later its “chief people officer,” also played an important role in the\r\nhiring process and in shaping the company’s culture. In a 2000\r\nHarvard Business School case study on the company, she\r\ncommented that “Alibaba employees don’t need experience. They\r\nneed good health, a good heart, and a good head.”\r\nAs the website’s members grew, companies in China began to\r\nuse the site to connect with one another as well as to the outside\r\nworld, prompting the launch of a Chinese-language marketplace12 for\r\nwholesalers in China seeking domestic trade leads.\r\nYet Alibaba still encountered difficulties winning converts to the\r\ne-commerce cause. Some balked at the high costs of buying\r\ncomputers; others lacked personnel with a sufficient understanding of\r\nIT. An even bigger obstacle was a pervasive lack of trust. Suppliers\r\nworried that customers they had never met might never pay for their\r\norders. Buyers overseas were concerned about fake or defective\r\ngoods, or shipments that never arrived.\r\nAlibaba couldn’t wave a magic wand to make these risks go\r\naway, as Jack emphasized to the media: “We are just a platform for\r\nbusinesspeople to meet, but we do not take legal responsibility.”\r\nAlibaba kept its focus as a bulletin board for businesses. But others,\r\nsuch as MeetChina, were talking up their plans to expand into areas\r\nlike market research, credit checks on suppliers, quality inspections,\r\nshipping, insurance, and payments.\r\nJack argued this was premature: “Small- and medium-sized\r\ncompanies do not trust transactions online yet. And we believe the\r\ncurrent banking system is good enough for small business. As long\r\nas our members feel it’s easy, they’d prefer to do their transactions\r\noffline.”\r\nAlibaba was struggling to define itself in ways that investors\r\ncould understand: “We don’t really have a clearly defined business\r\nmodel yet,” Jack admitted. “If you consider Yahoo a search engine,\r\nAmazon a bookstore, eBay an auction center, Alibaba is an electronic\r\nmarket. Yahoo and Amazon are not perfect models and we’re still\r\ntrying to figure out what’s best.”\r\nGoldman’s cash had helped, but the commitment to free listings\r\nmeant that Alibaba had to raise more capital soon, something made\r\nmore pressing by the opening of the new Hong Kong office and\r\nanother in Shanghai, which Alibaba announced would serve as its\r\nnew China headquarters. To sign up more customers, Alibaba started\r\nto host gatherings of SMEs in hotel ballrooms, arranging tables to\r\ngroup together companies from similar industries.\r\nDespite the hectic pace during the Internet bubble, and the\r\ngrowing sense of inevitability that it would soon pop, Jack betrayed\r\nfew signs of anxiety. I visited Hangzhou several times in late 1999\r\nand 2000 and witnessed Alibaba sprout from the Lakeside apartment\r\nthrough a series of ever-larger offices.\r\nI never witnessed Jack lose his cool, even when he dinged the\r\nfender of his car one day on a concrete column when we were\r\nparking at a restaurant where he’d invited me to lunch. I always found\r\nmy visits to Hangzhou enjoyable. Spending time with Jack was\r\ninvariably good fun. Like many visits before and since, I enjoyed\r\nseeing the city’s sites. On one visit Jack’s wife, Cathy, took me to visit\r\nthe famous Long Jing (Dragon Well) tea plantations, including a walk\r\nthrough the bamboo forest nearby—a breath of fresh air (literally)\r\nafter Beijing.\r\nJack was now spending much of his time away from Hangzhou,\r\nspeaking at industry and investor conferences. In January 2000 we\r\nwere both invited to speak at a student-organized event13 at Harvard.\r\nI met up with Jack before the conference. As we walked along an icy\r\npathway on the banks of the Charles River I noticed one of his\r\nentourage was filming the scene, something I later discovered she\r\nhad been doing for years already.\r\nThe conference featured a number of other China Internet\r\nentrepreneurs, most with much stronger academic pedigrees than\r\nJack. Some were recent returnees to China like Shao Yibo of\r\nEachNet, who had actually studied at Harvard. Peter Yip from\r\nChina.com was also there.\r\nBut Jack quickly emerged as the star of the show, especially\r\nwhen he confessed to the audience that he really had no idea what\r\nAlibaba’s business model was, adding “and yet I got investment from\r\nGoldman Sachs!”\r\nJack reveled in the attention he received at Harvard, including\r\nthe moniker “Crazy Jack” that Time magazine gave him shortly after.\r\nHe particularly enjoyed talking about the reversal of fortune of being\r\nonce rejected14 by Harvard but later being invited there to give a talk.\r\n“I did not get an education from Harvard . . . I went to Harvard to\r\neducate them.”\r\nJack has always been dismissive of business schools: “It is not\r\nnecessary to study an MBA. Most MBA graduates are not useful. . . .\r\nUnless they come back from their MBA studies and forget what\r\nthey’ve learned at school, then they will be useful. Because schools\r\nteach knowledge, while starting businesses requires wisdom.\r\nWisdom is acquired through experience. Knowledge can be acquired\r\nthrough hard work.”\r\nSoftBank Invests\r\nOne of the reasons that Jack was on such a high at Harvard was that\r\nhe was on the verge of announcing another important milestone for\r\nAlibaba: $20 million in fresh funding from the Japanese investment\r\nfirm SoftBank.\r\nWith this, and a subsequent investment, SoftBank became\r\nAlibaba’s largest shareholder. The deal was teed up by Alibaba’s\r\ninvestor, Goldman Sachs. SoftBank was on the lookout for tech\r\ninvestment opportunities in China when Mark Schwartz, then\r\npresident of Goldman Sachs Japan, told Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s\r\nfounder, about the bank’s growing portfolio of tech investments in\r\nChina.\r\nIn October 1999, Jack was one of several entrepreneurs invited\r\nto meet Masayoshi Son in one of a series of “speed dating” sessions\r\nbetween the Chinese start-ups and the Japanese billionaire arranged\r\nby Chauncey Shey, president of SoftBank China Venture Capital. The\r\ntwo men met at the wedding cake–styled Fuhua Mansion in Beijing.\r\nThe venue turned out to be a fitting one, their meeting the start of an\r\nenduring partnership that would eventually make Son the richest man\r\nin Japan. Son’s backing of Jack, coming just months before the dotcom\r\ncrash, transformed Alibaba’s fortunes.\r\nMasayoshi Son\r\nMasayoshi Son, known to his friends as “Masa,” shares some\r\nsimilarities with Jack. Both are short in stature and known for their\r\noutsize ambitions.\r\nSon grew up in circumstances even more difficult than Jack’s.\r\nBorn on Japan’s southernmost main island of Kyushu, the Sons lived\r\nin a shack that didn’t even have an official address. His father was a\r\npig farmer who brewed moonshine on the side. Son was bullied for\r\nbeing ethnically Korean and was forced to adopt the Japanese\r\nsurname Yasumoto. At the age of sixteen, Son moved to Northern\r\nCalifornia in search of a brighter future. Staying with friends and\r\nfamily, he attended Serramonte High School in Daly City, just south of\r\nSan Francisco, before gaining acceptance to the University of\r\nCalifornia, Berkeley, where he started his entrepreneurial career. His\r\nmost successful venture was building a voice-operated translation\r\ndevice to be sold at airport kiosks. Son designed, built, and then\r\nlicensed the technology to Sharp Electronics for half a million dollars.\r\nIn the United States, Son started to import early models of the Pac-\r\nMan and Space Invaders game consoles that were becoming popular\r\nat the time, leasing them to local bars and restaurants, including\r\nYoshi’s, a North Berkeley sushi bar (now a famous Bay Area jazz\r\nvenue). At Berkeley, he also met and hired Lu Hongliang, whose\r\nventure, Unitech Industries (renamed Unitech Telecom in 1994), later\r\nbecame part of the technology venture UTStarcom, the Hangzhoubased\r\ncompany in which SoftBank invested in 1995.\r\nAfter moving back to Japan in the early 1980s, Son started a\r\nsoftware distribution company. At the launch of the venture, in a\r\nscene echoing Jack’s own irrepressible optimism, he famously\r\nclimbed on top of a shipping box in front of his employees—just two\r\nat the time, both working part-time—and vowed that their new venture\r\nwould make 50 billion yen ($3 billion) in revenues within ten years.\r\nBy the time he first met Jack, Son had become a billionaire many\r\ntimes over. He was known for making quick decisions. One of his\r\nbest was the prescient investment he made in Yahoo in 1995. When\r\nYahoo went public in 1996, Son topped up SoftBank’s stake in the\r\nportal to 37 percent, becoming its largest investor. Son also\r\nnegotiated the right for SoftBank to become Yahoo’s exclusive\r\npartner in Japan, a deal that would yield him tens of billions more.\r\nMeeting Son, Jack knew he had found a kindred spirit. “We didn’t\r\ntalk about revenues; we didn’t even talk about a business model. . . .\r\nWe just talked about a shared vision. Both of us make quick\r\ndecisions,” Jack recalled.\r\n“When I went to see Masayoshi Son, I didn’t even wear a suit\r\nthat day. . . . After five or six minutes, he began to like me and I\r\nbegan to like him. . . . People around him have said that we are soul\r\nmates.”\r\nAt their first meeting, after Jack had finished describing Alibaba,\r\nby now some 100,000 members strong, Son immediately turned the\r\nconversation to how much SoftBank could invest. “I listened to Mr.\r\nMa’s speech for five minutes and decided on the spot that I was\r\nready to invest in Alibaba,” Son recalled. Son interrupted Jack’s\r\npresentation to tell him he should take SoftBank’s money because he\r\n“should spend money more quickly.” Around the time of Alibaba’s\r\n2014 IPO, Son was asked what it was that prompted him to bet on\r\nJack back in 2000: “It was the look in his eye, it was an ‘animal smell.’\r\n. . . It was the same when we invested in Yahoo . . . when they were\r\nstill only five to six people. I invested based on my sense of smell.”\r\nThis impulsiveness was typical for Son. “Masa is Masa. He has\r\nADD [attention deficit disorder] and can’t sit still. He just wants to give\r\nyou money now, now!” commented a former business associate.\r\nA few weeks after their first meeting in Beijing, Son invited Jack\r\nto Tokyo to finalize terms. Joe Tsai joined him on the trip.\r\nAs soon as they entered Son’s office, the negotiations began.\r\nJack would later infuse his description of their meeting with martial art\r\nimagery: “Masters of negotiation always listen, don’t talk. Those who\r\ntalk a lot only have second-rate negotiation skills. A true master\r\nlistens, and as soon as he moves his sword, you pretty much\r\ncollapse.”\r\nJoe, who had met up with SoftBank China’s Chauncey Shey\r\nbefore the trip, told me the details of their meeting. “Goldman and the\r\nother funds had just invested $5 million for half of the company,\r\nvaluing Alibaba at $10 million. Masa opened the negotiations by\r\noffering $20 million for 40 percent of the company. This valued\r\nAlibaba at $50 million ‘post-money,’ and $30 million ‘pre-money.’ In\r\njust weeks, Goldman’s investment had increased in value by three\r\ntimes.”\r\nJoe and Jack looked at each other, Joe recalled, thinking,\r\n“Woohoo, that’s three-times! But then we thought, we didn’t want to\r\ngive up too much equity. So Jack said, ‘Masa, that doesn’t work for\r\nus.’ Masa had a calculator; he was literally doing the math right there.\r\nBut Masa wanted 40 percent, so he said, ‘How about double the\r\namount. I put $40 million for 40 percent.’ That means $60 million premoney.”\r\nJack and Joe offered to think it over. Upon their return to China,\r\nJack wrote Son an email turning down the $40 million investment.\r\nInstead he offered to take in $20 million for 30 percent, adding, “If you\r\nagree, we will go ahead; if not, that’s it.” Jack later explained why he\r\nturned down the larger amount: “Why would I need to take so much\r\nmoney? I didn’t know how to use it, and there would definitely be\r\nproblems.” Jack didn’t have to wait long for his reply from Son, which\r\ncame in the form of two words: “Go ahead.”\r\nJack credits fortune with playing a hand in connecting him with\r\nSon, conceding that “[i]t is quite difficult to find such an investor.”\r\nCommenting on the dynamics of their relationship, Jack said, “I think\r\nMasa is definitely one of the world’s best [businessmen], very sharp\r\non investment.” But he adds Son is also a good operator of business,\r\ntoo: “It’s not easy to shift from investor to operator and meanwhile still\r\nbe a good investor. For me, I’m just an operator. I love to be an\r\nentrepreneur. I’m not a good investor.”\r\nJack also liked to joke about their appearances: “The difference\r\nbetween me and him is that I may look very smart, [but] in fact I am\r\nnot; that guy seriously doesn’t look very smart, but he is a very wise\r\nperson.”\r\nAn early Alibaba employee, Shou Yuan, has an interesting take\r\non the relationship between the two founder-CEOs: “Son has a lot of\r\nself-confidence, he’s even conceited, but his appearance is always\r\none of modesty. He’s crazy, but Ma’s also crazy. It’s very common for\r\ncrazy people to like each other.”\r\nAnnouncing the deal, Son himself drew a comparison with his\r\nwildly successful investment in Yahoo.\r\n“We would like to make Alibaba the next Yahoo. . . . I think this\r\nwill probably be the first Chinese Internet company which will become\r\na global brand, a global success in a big way. I am very excited to\r\nmake that happen.”\r\nThe two firms also announced a joint venture for Alibaba Korea,\r\nwhich would launch in June 2000, to fend off the growth of a local\r\nplayer there, and drew up plans for a site in Japan as well.\r\nThe deal was clearly a transformative one for Alibaba, and cause\r\nfor celebration. In less than a year after the company’s founding, Jack\r\nand Joe had reeled in $25 million from two of the largest and most\r\nprestigious investors in the world.\r\nThe deal was not without a price: The sale of 30 percent of\r\nAlibaba to SoftBank came on the heels of the sale of 50 percent of\r\nthe company to Goldman Sachs, meaning a hefty dilution of Jack’s\r\nstake.\r\nYet the SoftBank investment provided Alibaba with serious street\r\ncred in China, just as the three Chinese Internet portals geared up for\r\ntheir U.S. IPOs. The deal also gave Alibaba insurance. No one could\r\npredict with any certainty how long the tech investment boom would\r\nlast. SoftBank’s $20 million allowed it to build out a much longer\r\n“runway” on which to achieve takeoff and future profitability.\r\nJack wanted to be noticed in Silicon Valley, too. Soon after he\r\nsecured the $20 million investment from SoftBank, Jack headed to\r\nSanta Clara, California, the home of Yahoo. He traveled there to offer\r\nJohn Wu15—a Yahoo executive whom Jack had first met when\r\nworking at China Pages—the post of chief technology officer of\r\nAlibaba. It was an ambitious pitch. Jack was proposing that John take\r\na 50 percent pay cut and leave the hottest company in Silicon Valley\r\nfor a risky start-up in Hangzhou.\r\nJohn expressed his misgivings to Jack, as he later recalled,\r\n“Yahoo was doing well, my parents were immigrating to the U.S., I\r\nwasn’t seriously considering this possibility.” He was particularly keen\r\nto avoid moving his family back to China. Instead Jack proposed he\r\nrun Alibaba’s R&D team from Fremont, California. John accepted.\r\nJack, with a background as an English teacher, was keen to\r\nensure that his own ignorance of technology was not replicated in\r\nAlibaba. “For a first-class company, we need first-class technology.\r\nWhen John comes, I can sleep soundly.” Hiring John Wu also gave\r\nJack the opportunity to sprinkle some more Yahoo stardust on his\r\nventure. Sitting next to Jack in a press conference, John described\r\nAlibaba as a new form of Yahoo: “Yahoo’s search engine has shaped\r\nthe way millions of people surf the Internet. Now Alibaba’s ecommerce\r\nplatform will fundamentally change the way people\r\nconduct business online.” The Los Angeles Times commented that\r\nthe “ability of a Chinese start-up to poach one of Silicon Valley’s key\r\nplayers could bolster China’s claim as the ultimate Internet frontier for\r\nthe best minds in the industry.”\r\nJohn jumped from Yahoo to Alibaba, he explained, because\r\nAlibaba’s idea was an original one. “If you compare the other leading\r\nInternet companies in China,” he said, “almost all of them are copying\r\nbusiness models already existing in the U.S.” Shirley Lin at Goldman\r\nSachs had been attracted to Alibaba for its “localness.” John Wu saw\r\nthe same merits: “There are a lot of Internet companies started by\r\npeople who studied in the U.S. and came back to China. . . . Jack Ma\r\nis different. He has been in China all his life.”\r\nWith fresh capital, new recruits, and more than 150,000\r\nmembers in 188 countries signed up on the website, things were\r\nlooking up for Alibaba. But the bubble was about to pop.\r\nChapter Eight\r\nBurst and Back to China\r\nBe the last man standing.\r\n—Jack Ma\r\nBy the spring of 2000, Alibaba was signing up more than a thousand\r\nnew members a day.\r\nConnecting suppliers in China with global buyers was clearly a\r\ngood idea. But other companies with the same idea were\r\nproliferating, and some actively raising capital, too. MeetChina raised\r\nanother $11 million, some of which came from a SoftBank fund, and\r\nannounced a sales target of $10 million that year and planning for an\r\nIPO. Global Sources, the veteran publisher of trade magazines,\r\nannounced it had hired Goldman Sachs to prepare for a Nasdaq IPO\r\nand stepped up its hiring in China.\r\nOther contenders entered the fray as well, including\r\nentrepreneurs1 who pivoted to business-to-business e-commerce\r\nafter seeing Alibaba’s success in raising capital.\r\nFaced with increasing competition, and flush with cash, Alibaba\r\naccelerated its expansion. In the months following SoftBank’s\r\ninvestment, the company went on a hiring spree in mainland China,\r\nHong Kong, and Fremont, California, where incoming CTO John Wu\r\nset up their U.S. outpost.\r\nGovernment on the Fence\r\nSpeculation grew about an IPO. Yet the most likely companies to go\r\npublic, the three Chinese portals, had hit a roadblock. Their success\r\nwas helping popularize the consumer Internet faster than the\r\ngovernment had expected. Four million Internet users was a drop in\r\nthe ocean in a population of 1.3 billion. Yet the things that made the\r\nportals popular, especially email and news, made a government bent\r\non control increasingly nervous.\r\nWithin China’s ruling Communist Party a debate was raging over\r\nhow to handle the Internet. Conservatives pointed out that the\r\nInternet had originated as the project of a U.S. defense agency. They\r\nargued that just because it was new, there was no reason to exclude\r\nInternet companies from the same restrictions that prevented or\r\nseverely constrained foreign investment in the telecom sector or in\r\nprint, radio, film, and TV. There was no “Ministry of Internet,” but the\r\nInternet touched so many areas that it set off bitter turf battles\r\nbetween existing regulators. To demonstrate their relevance, China’s\r\nregulators regulate regularly, manifested in the “Great Firewall of\r\nChina,” under construction ever since the Internet came to China’s\r\nshore, an unceasing effort to filter content they deemed a threat to\r\nthe country or to Communist Party rule.\r\nAt the same time, with its huge investments in telecom\r\ninfrastructure the government had been actually pushing xinxihua—\r\ninformatization—as essential for developing China’s economy. There\r\nwas consensus among the all-powerful politburo standing committee\r\n—nearly all trained as engineers—that China needed a “knowledge\r\neconomy.”\r\nAn inability to adapt to new technology could spell disaster. The\r\nfall of the Qing dynasty is popularly attributed in part to its failure to\r\nadapt to modern military and industrial technologies, leaving it\r\nvulnerable to domination by Western powers. Some in China also\r\nblamed the fall of the Soviet Union on a failure to keep up with waves\r\nof technological advances in Silicon Valley, such as the\r\nsemiconductor, computer, and software industries.\r\nBut the government rejected any notion that the Internet would\r\nusher in the Western concept of an “information society,” something\r\nthey believed could pose an existential threat to the Communist\r\nParty. Yet without foreign investment, how could China’s Internet\r\nentrepreneurs finance their ventures? Restricting them to domestic\r\nfinancing channels was impractical. China’s own venture capital\r\nmarket was in its infancy, and its stock markets were dominated by\r\nSOEs. In any case, the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges required\r\ncompanies to have been in business for at least three years, and to\r\nbe profitable. All of China’s Internet companies were new, and\r\noperating unashamedly at a loss.\r\nChina wanted a Silicon Valley, but one that it could control, built\r\non its terms. Yet the distributed, bottom-up nature of the Internet was\r\ninimical to China’s traditions, both imperial and Leninist, of top-down\r\ncontrol of information. For those coming online, this was the Internet’s\r\ncentral appeal.\r\nProfessor Xu Rongsheng, who had helped establish the first\r\nconnection between the Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing\r\nand Stanford University, describes the impact of the Internet as an\r\n“information bomb” exploding over China. Another popular description\r\nwas that the Internet was “God’s gift to the Chinese,” something\r\nechoed by investors and dissidents2 alike.\r\nUnable to stop the Internet, but nervous about facilitating its rise,\r\nhow was the government to proceed?\r\nHow could Chinese Internet entrepreneurs raise money overseas\r\nwithout their companies being classified as foreign companies and\r\nwalled off from businesses in China? To resolve the contradiction the\r\nthree portals attempted all manner of contortions to secure\r\ngovernment approval for their IPOs, arguing they weren’t even\r\nInternet companies.\r\nAfter months of debate, an accommodation was finally reached:\r\nthe “VIE.” The VIE, or “variable interest entity,” is much loved by\r\ncorporate lawyers in China for its rich, fee-producing complexity. Still\r\nin use today, it allows the Chinese government effectively to have its\r\ncake and eat it, too—in this case allowing a thriving entrepreneurial\r\nInternet, while maintaining control. The VIE is the subject of ongoing\r\ndebate for investors in Alibaba—how much protection does it really\r\ngive them? The structure allows foreign investors a degree of control\r\nover the revenues generated by a Chinese company (through a\r\ncomplicated arrangement of interlocking contracts) that, thanks to the\r\npersonal engagement of Chinese entrepreneur founders, continues to\r\ntreat that company as Chinese.\r\nThe compromise was brokered by Sina (and its lawyers) with the\r\nMinistry of Information Industry (MII), amongst other agencies. MII\r\nminister Wu Jichuan had earlier stood in the way of any portal IPOs,\r\nbut the VIE broke the logjam. His voice carried weight, as he was the\r\narchitect of the drive for “informatization,” the investment in\r\ninfrastructure without which the country’s Internet boom would not\r\nhave been possible. The VIE has its origins in another complicated\r\ninvestment structure3 that a few years earlier Wu, ironically, had\r\ntaken the lead in dismantling.\r\nOn April 13, 2000, the first of the three Chinese portals finally got\r\nits IPO. Sina raised $68 million on the Nasdaq. NetEase and Sohu\r\nsoon followed.\r\nBut the portals were to have a very difficult birth as public\r\ncompanies. The reason? The bubble had burst.\r\nBubble Ball and Burst\r\nFrom its peak in March 2000, the Nasdaq began a two-year losing\r\nstreak, wiping out trillions of dollars of market capitalization and\r\ntaking down many technology firms with it. NetEase’s shares dropped\r\n20 percent on the first day of trading after its IPO in June. Sohu\r\nlimped to an IPO in July but after that there would be no more\r\nissuances for Chinese Internet companies for more than three years.\r\nThe IPO door was now firmly shut to the other Chinese Internet\r\ncompanies, including Alibaba, as investors once again cared about\r\nrevenues and profits.\r\nJust as the markets started to tank, and on the fringes of the\r\nInternet World conference in Beijing, I hosted a party at a business\r\nclub called the Capital Club. I titled the party, as a joke, “The Bubble\r\nBall.” They say you never know you’re in a bubble until it pops. But in\r\nthe spring of 2000 there was a growing sense that everything was\r\nabout to come to a crashing halt.\r\nFor me the trigger was an event a few weeks after Time\r\nmagazine ran a cover story, on February 28, 2000, on the Chinese\r\nInternet market, entitled “struggle.com.” The opening paragraph was\r\na story I had told to Time journalist Terry McCarthy about my first\r\nmeeting with one of the portal pioneers:\r\nWilliam Ding, founder of Netease, one of China’s top Internet\r\nportals, was uneasy. As he talked to a friend in a Beijing\r\nrestaurant last summer, something was irritating him. The airconditioning.\r\nIt was too cold. Without interrupting the\r\nconversation, the self-taught techie took out his Palm Pilot\r\nelectronic organizer, pointed the infrared port at the aircon unit\r\nand adjusted the temperature from across the room. His friend’s\r\njaw dropped.\r\nAt an extravagant dinner party hosted in Shanghai on the\r\ngrounds of a colonial-era mansion a few weeks after the Time article\r\nran, an investor came up to introduce herself and told me excitedly\r\nabout how our host, a senior investment banker, had confided that\r\nshe, not I, was the “friend” featured in the article. Wounded ego\r\naside, I started to realize that, as the bankers began to invent stories\r\nof their closeness to the entrepreneur, the days of the Internet boom\r\nwere numbered.\r\nThe Bubble Ball name proved more apt than I could have\r\nimagined. Jack came along and danced until the small hours, along\r\nwith Charles Zhang from Sohu—in a unique style that reminded me\r\nof Elaine Benes in Seinfeld—William Ding from NetEase, and four\r\nhundred others, in what turned out to be the last party of a short-lived\r\nbut Gatsbyesque era. CNN and the Australian broadcaster ABC were\r\nthere to videotape the scene. Viewed today, the graininess of the\r\nvideos conveys how long ago it was but also the unbridled\r\nexuberance of that time.\r\nFor Jack, the bursting of the bubble represented a great\r\nopportunity for Alibaba. “I made a call to our Hangzhou team and\r\nsaid, ‘Have you heard the exciting news about the Nasdaq?’ . . . I’d\r\nlike to have had a bottle of champagne on hand,” adding, “This is\r\nhealthy for the market, and it’s very healthy for companies like us.”\r\nHe felt confident that now the IPO gate had closed, venture\r\ncapitalists would stop funding Alibaba’s competitors. “In the next\r\nthree months more than sixty percent of the Internet companies in\r\nChina will close their doors,” he said, adding that Alibaba had spent\r\nonly $5 million of the $25 million it had raised. “We haven’t touched\r\nour second-round funding. We have lots of gasoline in our tank.”\r\nWith the field opening up, Alibaba increased its hiring of foreign\r\nemployees to market the company to buyers overseas. Jack started\r\nto travel intensively around the world to attend trade shows and meet\r\nchambers of commerce. Jack was by this time quite familiar with the\r\nUnited States. On his first trips to Europe, though, he experienced\r\nsome culture shock. I advised Alibaba on its expansion strategy\r\nthere, recommending a Swiss friend of mine, Abir Oreibi, who would\r\noversee the company’s European operations for the next eight years.\r\nOn his first visit to London, Jack was booked into the city’s prestigious\r\nConnaught Hotel but couldn’t understand why he had to stay in such\r\nan old building. In Zurich, Jack and Cathy were perplexed by the fact\r\nthat all the shops were closed. Abir explained that it was a Sunday,\r\nprompting Cathy to exclaim, “Oh, I see, they’re all working second\r\njobs today.” Coming from the nonstop business culture of China, the\r\nconcept of shopkeepers taking a whole day off to rest was\r\nunimaginable.\r\nAlibaba stepped up its advertising, too. Suddenly the company’s\r\nsignature orange blanketed print and online media in the mainland,\r\nincluding on the Chinese portals. Alibaba commissioned a glossy\r\ntelevision ad that ran on CNBC and CNN, a first for a China-based\r\ntech start-up. Todd Daum, an American executive who had recently\r\njoined Alibaba in Hong Kong, oversaw the production of the video,\r\nwhich Jack described to him jokingly as “my second favorite video,\r\nafter Forrest Gump.”\r\nTV ad campaigns aside, Jack continued to be Alibaba’s most\r\neffective marketing tool. Despite the dot-com downturn, people came\r\nin droves to hear his speeches. When he spoke in Hong Kong in May\r\n2000 at an I&I (Internet & Information Asia) event in the Furama\r\nHotel, more than five hundred people turned up. Jack was gaining\r\nprofile overseas, too, invited as a global Internet luminary to an\r\nInternet event in Barcelona, Spain. As Alibaba surpassed the\r\n300,000-member mark, Jack was featured on the cover of Forbes\r\nGlobal magazine, which named the company—along with Global\r\nSources—as “Best of the Web” for B2B e-commerce. That was\r\nfollowed by a full-page profile in The Economist titled “The Jack Who\r\nWould Be King.”\r\nBut as the stock market continued its downward slide,\r\nenthusiasm for Internet companies of any description began to\r\ndwindle. In August 2000, NetEase’s shares sank below a third of their\r\nIPO price, and Sohu’s under half. In late July, only five months after a\r\nblockbuster Hong Kong IPO, the local portal Tom.com, backed by\r\nbillionaire Li Ka-shing, laid off eighty employees. China.com followed\r\nsuit soon after.\r\nThe Internet conferences started to thin out. I&I even dropped\r\nthe word Internet and then faded into oblivion along with many of the\r\ncompanies that had once presented at its events. Dot-com had\r\nbecome dot-bomb.\r\nAt a venture capital investor conference in Hong Kong that fall,\r\nJack was one of the featured speakers. In a dramatic reversal from\r\nthe crowds that Jack had drawn just a few months earlier, Goldman\r\nSachs had to scramble to find people to fill an empty conference\r\nroom to hear his pitch. Standing at the podium in front of a skeptical\r\naudience, an investor recounted to me, Jack cupped his hands in\r\nfront of his face, squinted his eyes, and declared, “I can see the end\r\nof the tunnel.” But in the face of growing investor cynicism about the\r\nsector, Jack Magic was wearing off.\r\nMeanwhile, in California, Alibaba’s efforts to build an R&D center\r\nunder John Wu’s leadership were running into problems. In an effort\r\nto overhaul the company’s disparate software platforms, Alibaba had\r\nhired more than thirty engineers in its new Fremont office, but\r\ncoordinating with their colleagues in China across a fifteen-hour time\r\ndifference was proving a headache. Forced to use English for the\r\nbenefit of non-Chinese-speaking colleagues in California, Chinese\r\nengineers in both offices struggled to communicate among\r\nthemselves. The team started to fracture and tempers frayed as\r\nHangzhou pushed to develop one product and Fremont another. After\r\nan infrastructure upgrade, the whole Alibaba.com site went down.\r\nJack was visiting Fremont at the time and had to step in personally to\r\nforce better cooperation between the two teams so that the problem\r\ncould be fixed. It was clear that splitting the technology team across\r\nthe Pacific had failed. Alibaba started to move core functions back to\r\nHangzhou. Alibaba was about to embark on a new, defensive\r\nstrategy: “B2C,” or “Back to China.”\r\nPressures were mounting on Jack, including from his first\r\ninvestor Goldman Sachs, to prove that Alibaba could actually make\r\nmoney. “Alibaba.com has a revenue plan for today, tomorrow, and the\r\nday after tomorrow,” Jack commented. “Today we are focused on\r\nrevenues from online marketing services. Tomorrow, we will add\r\nrevenue sharing with third-party service providers. And the day after\r\ntomorrow, we will add transaction-based revenues.”\r\nTo reassure investors and his team, Alibaba agreed to look at\r\noffering third-party services such as credit, transport, and insurance\r\nservices. Together these accounted for as much as $300 billion in\r\nannual revenues on total global trade of $7 trillion. Grabbing even a\r\nsmall slice of this pie could be extremely lucrative.\r\nThis was the strategy already touted by MeetChina. The\r\ncompany claimed that more than 70,000 Chinese suppliers and\r\n15,000 prospective purchasers had joined its site. Although few\r\ntransactions had been facilitated online, it disclosed it planned to take\r\n2 to 6 percent of all transactions on its site. Bucking the investment\r\ndownturn, MeetChina surprised the market with a fresh venture\r\ncapital infusion of $30 million, taking its total haul to over $40 million,\r\nsome $15 million more than Alibaba. Cofounder Thomas Rosenthal\r\ntold reporters, “The volatility of the Nasdaq actually made it relatively\r\neasier to get private financing. You have a large amount of money\r\nchasing fewer deals.” Recently appointed CEO Len Cordiner pursued\r\na vision for the site as a place where “you cannot only find buyers but\r\nalso negotiate online.” But MeetChina would never make much\r\nheadway in China. Talking up partnerships with third parties was\r\nmuch easier than making them work, and many of the tie-ups ending\r\nup being nothing more than links to its partners’ websites. A former\r\nemployee4 later summed up MeetChina’s experience as spending\r\n$30 million to “train Chinese enterprises to use the Internet.”\r\nEventually the company switched focus to Southeast Asia, launching\r\nMeetPhilippines.com and MeetVietnam.com (in the presence of\r\nPresident Clinton) and inking partnerships in India, Indonesia, South\r\nKorea, and Thailand, before it folded.5\r\nJack had long been dismissive of MeetChina, and as it fell to the\r\nwayside he turned his guns on Global Sources, now Alibaba’s main\r\nrival, and its founder, Merle Hinrichs. Jack dismissed Global Sources\r\nas an “old economy” company that had misunderstood the nature of\r\nonline trade: “They are a company pushing a publication.” Merle\r\nHinrichs in turn dismissed Alibaba as “a mile wide and half an inch\r\ndeep.” Although Global Sources’ (recently listed) shares6 had tanked\r\nalong with the Nasdaq, it was buoyed by substantial profits generated\r\nfrom its offline print business.\r\nLater in 2000, Jack and Hinrichs were both keynote speakers at\r\nan Internet conference in Hong Kong. Although he never referred to\r\nHinrichs by name, Jack later told a story about a rival (who owned “a\r\nbeautiful yacht”) who after paying a $50,000 fee to be a keynote\r\nspeaker was incensed to find that Jack had been invited to give a\r\nkeynote speech without having to pay a fee. The conference\r\norganizers explained to his rival, so Jack’s story goes, that “it is\r\nbecause you want to be a keynote speaker, but the audience wants\r\nJack Ma to speak,” to which his rival vowed, “I will sail the yacht to\r\nHong Kong and will invite all the keynote speakers and speakers of\r\nthe conference to have a party on my yacht, but I have one condition:\r\nthat Jack Ma is not allowed.” Merle Hinrichs’s office declined to\r\ncomment on the spat, but the rivalry is something that Jack, the\r\nphilosopher CEO, invested with a deeper meaning: “If you can’t\r\ntolerate your opponents, you will be definitely beaten by your\r\nopponent. . . . If you treat your opponents as enemies, you have\r\nalready lost at the beginning of the game. If you hang your opponent\r\nas a target, and practice throwing darts at him every day, you are only\r\nable to fight this one enemy, not others. . . . Competition is the\r\ngreatest joy. When you compete with others, and find that it brings\r\nyou more and more agony, there must be something wrong with your\r\ncompetition strategy.”\r\nBut in the latter half of 2000, it looked like there was something\r\nwrong with Alibaba’s strategy. Although it had raised $25 million and\r\nsigned up more than half a million users, its revenues that year\r\nwouldn’t even hit the $1 million mark. Alibaba did start to charge\r\nsome fees—helping build and host websites for some of its members\r\n—but expenses were increasing far more rapidly than revenues.\r\nAlibaba’s hiring spree was creating more problems than it solved, as\r\nnew recruits arrived before reporting and budgeting systems had\r\nbeen put in place. The international nature of its business was also a\r\nchallenge, both in dealing with clients and in managing human\r\nresources. Trying to market a Chinese company with an Arabic name\r\nto clients in the United States and Europe wasn’t proving easy, and\r\nJack admitted that “managing a multinational organization is no easy\r\ntask with the language and cultural gaps.”\r\nAs the tech downturn continued into 2001, Jack and Joe\r\nrecognized that things needed to change. In January 2001 they\r\nbrought on board as chief operating officer Savio Kwan, a fifty-twoyear-\r\nold veteran of GE,7 who gave a frank assessment of the\r\ncompany: “We need to ground [Alibaba] in reality and make it into a\r\nbusiness.”\r\nBack to China\r\nKwan’s arrival heralded a new management structure that became\r\nknown internally as the “Four O’s”: Jack as CEO, Joe Tsai as CFO,\r\nJohn Wu as CTO, and Savio Kwan as COO. To signal to the\r\ncompany how serious he was about change, Jack divided his own\r\noffice in Hangzhou in two, giving the other half to Kwan.\r\nKwan slashed monthly expenses by as much as half, stepping\r\nup the “Back to China” retrenchment. A joint venture in South Korea\r\nwas scrapped and Alibaba’s Silicon Valley presence drastically scaled\r\nback. Many of the higher-paid foreign employees were let go.\r\nExpensive advertising campaigns were abandoned and replaced with\r\nword-of-mouth marketing. Reducing expenses overseas allowed\r\nAlibaba to increase its hiring at home, leveraging Hangzhou’s deep\r\npool of lower-cost talent. It rapidly expanded its sales team to focus\r\non promoting fee-paying services such as TrustPass, which provided\r\ncredit information and authentication services, and Gold Supplier,\r\nwhich gave exporters in China their own presence on Alibaba’s\r\nEnglish-language website. For $3,600 they could use this to display\r\ntheir products and prices and be linked to Alibaba’s search engine.\r\nGold Supplier was explicitly designed to undercut the $10,000–\r\n$12,000 in annual fees that Global Sources charged for its online\r\nlistings.\r\nDespite the early promise from these new revenue sources,\r\nAlibaba was taking a beating. Since it was still a private company the\r\nnegative sentiment couldn’t be measured in dollars and cents, unlike\r\nthe three portals, whose shares had by now been reduced to penny\r\nstocks. BusinessWeek ran an article in April 2001 titled “Alibaba’s\r\nMagic Carpet Is Losing Altitude,” which concluded that the “former\r\nprofessor will have to work hard to ensure his company doesn’t flunk\r\nout.” The company had initiated a restructuring that it hoped would\r\nturn things around, but in the years following the dot-com crash\r\nAlibaba was resigned to a very uncertain future. Jack even floated the\r\nprospect of quitting, so he could return to teaching before he turned\r\nforty.\r\nIn his darker moments, he took to comparing his struggles to\r\nthose of the revolutionary Mao Zedong after the Long March, even\r\ncalling for a “rectification movement” to set Alibaba on a new course:\r\n“Once many well-known managers in America came to Alibaba to be\r\nvice presidents. Each of them had their own opinions. . . . It was like a\r\nzoo at the time. Some were good at talking while others were quiet.\r\nTherefore, we think the most important purpose of a rectification\r\nmovement is to decide a shared purpose of Alibaba, and determine\r\nour value.”\r\nAlibaba’s reversal of fortunes had been dramatic, but it didn’t\r\nbreak the bond between Jack and Joe Tsai. I asked Joe what kept\r\nhim at Alibaba when everything seemed so bleak. “Alibaba,” he\r\nexplained, “was my fourth job. I wanted this job to work.” Unlike the\r\nthree portals, Joe also saw the advantages for Alibaba of not having\r\nhad an IPO. “I knew all of this was a bubble, and even if we had gone\r\npublic in 2000 we would have to live with the consequences, the\r\ndelivery. You would have had to grow into your valuation; it was a\r\nquick-buck kind of thing.”\r\nThe dark days of 2001 and 2002 would later become part of\r\nAlibaba lore. Jack later referred to the period in one of his pep talks to\r\nthe team: “At that time, my slogan was ‘Be the last man standing.’ Be\r\nthe last person to fall down. Even on my knees, I had to be the last\r\nman collapsing. I also believed firmly at that time [that] if I had\r\ndifficulties, there must be someone who had worse difficulties; if I had\r\na hard time, my opponents had an even harder time. Those who can\r\nstand and manage will win eventually.”\r\nIn the years that followed the dot-com crash, Alibaba slashed\r\ncosts and found a way to steadily increase its revenues. Even though\r\nthe venture capital market had dried up completely, Alibaba was able\r\nto stand on its own two feet. And thanks to a new business launched\r\nin the spring of 2003, it was about to succeed on a scale that even\r\nJack could never have imagined.\r\nChapter Nine\r\nBorn Again: Taobao and the\r\nHumiliation of eBay\r\nAmong China’s leading businessmen, Ma is known for his bombastic\r\ncomments. He routinely uses eBay as a dartboard while\r\nsimultaneously praising it as one of the companies he most admires.\r\n—San Francisco Chronicle\r\n“The pioneers take the arrows, settlers take the land” is a phrase\r\noften used to describe the conquering of the American West. As a\r\nnew frontier known as the Internet unfolded in China, Jack was\r\ndetermined to become one of the settlers. He’d already been a\r\npioneer with his early experience of going online in Seattle in 1995.\r\nBut with his first Internet venture, China Pages, he’d taken an arrow\r\nfrom his state-owned partner, leaving the portal pioneers (Wang\r\nZhidong of Sina, Charles Zhang of Sohu, and William Ding of\r\nNetEase) to become the settlers, the first Internet entrepreneurs in\r\nChina to lead their companies to an IPO. To close the gap, in\r\nSeptember 2000, Jack invited the three portal founders plus Wang\r\nJuntao—the chairman of consumer e-commerce venture 8848—to a\r\nmartial arts themed business conference entitled “Sword Discussion\r\nby the West Lake” (xihu lunjian)1 that he hosted in Hangzhou. I\r\nchaired a roundtable discussion at the event, held to promote the city\r\nas a “Silicon Paradise.” Jack announced that Alibaba would move its\r\nChina headquarters from Shanghai back to Hangzhou. This was\r\ndesigned no doubt to please the governor of Zhejiang and mayor of\r\nHangzhou, who were among the local dignitaries in attendance. But I\r\nquickly understood that the event, in particular the participation of the\r\nfour leading Internet figures of the day, was convened to demonstrate\r\nAlibaba’s continued relevance in China’s Internet sector. Even though\r\nthe company had not yet secured an IPO, Jack wanted to stay in the\r\nlimelight. Jack pulled this off with a clever idea: inviting VIP guest Jin\r\nYong, the Hong Kong author who had been an inspiration to Jack\r\nsince his childhood. He knew Jin Yong would be a big draw to the\r\nother Internet founders, too.\r\nShortly after Jack’s Hangzhou gathering, two of the four China\r\nInternet pioneers were felled. Wang Juntao, the chairman of\r\nconsumer e-commerce pioneer 8848, was forced out by investors\r\nnervous about the mounting costs incurred to overcome payment and\r\nlogistics hurdles. Wang Zhidong, the founder of Sina, was deposed in\r\na palace coup,2 victim of the company’s fractured and fractious\r\nshareholder base.\r\nNow only Jack, William Ding, and Charles Zhang remained at the\r\nhelm of the companies they had founded. Alibaba was surviving, but\r\nthe business-to-business e-commerce model he had chosen to follow\r\nwas proving a struggle. In the closing months of 2002, as Alibaba\r\nedged toward profitability, Jack started to look at a new direction for\r\nthe company: targeting China’s consumer e-commerce market. Two\r\nmodels from the United States stood out: Amazon and eBay.\r\nMimicking Amazon, 8848 had already folded. But two other\r\ndomestic “e-tailers,” both set up in 1999 when they had successfully\r\nraised venture capital,3 had survived, selling books and other\r\nproducts at fixed prices:4 Dangdang.com, run by cofounder Peggy Yu\r\n(Yu Yu), who had started her career as an interpreter and secretary at\r\na boiler manufacturer before studying for an MBA at New York\r\nUniversity, and Joyo.com, founded by Kingsoft’s Lei Jun (later of\r\nhandset vendor Xiaomi fame) and run by Diane Wang (Wang\r\nShutong).\r\nShao Yibo\r\neBay had proved an instant investor hit with its September 1998 IPO,\r\nits valuation growing from $2 billion to $30 billion by March 2000.\r\nNumerous entrepreneurs in China launched ventures that aspired to\r\nbe the eBay of China. Most prominent among them was a charismatic\r\nwunderkind from Shanghai called Shao Yibo, who had founded his\r\nfirm EachNet5 after returning to China in June 1999 from Harvard\r\nBusiness School. EachNet quickly pulled ahead of the other China\r\nclones.\r\nTo launch his consumer e-commerce attack, Jack opted to go the\r\neBay route, setting up a contest with EachNet. But in Shao Yibo,\r\nknown as Bo to his friends, Jack could very easily have met his\r\nmatch.\r\nBo came from a modest background. His parents were teachers.\r\nHis father sparked Bo’s interest in mathematics with a deck of cards.\r\nBo recalled, “With fifty-two cards, and scoring a king as thirteen etc.,\r\nthe deck adds up to three hundred and sixty-four. My father hid one\r\ncard and asked me to add up the rest. If I did it right, I would know\r\nwhat the hidden card was.”\r\nBo practiced relentlessly. By the age of twelve he could add up a\r\ndeck in twelve seconds. After winning more than a dozen high school\r\nmathematics competitions across the country, Bo became one of the\r\nfirst students from mainland China6 to be admitted directly to Harvard\r\nCollege on a full scholarship. After graduating he worked for two\r\nyears at Boston Consulting Group before returning to Harvard and\r\nenrolling at the business school. While Jack had already settled on\r\nbusiness-to-business e-commerce, Bo looked at a range of U.S.\r\nInternet businesses that might work in China and found that “The only\r\nbusiness model that got me excited was eBay.”\r\nBefore leaving Boston, Bo auctioned off his unwanted\r\npossessions—on eBay—and in June 1999, then twenty-six years old,\r\nreturned to Shanghai to build the eBay of China.\r\nBefore he even landed he had raised almost half a million dollars\r\nin funding.7 Nonetheless, “my parents thought I was nuts, to turn\r\ndown very lucrative job offers and a green card and become selfemployed,”\r\nBo recalled. “I was very naïve and totally unprepared for\r\nbusiness in general and the huge challenges of bootstrapping a startup\r\ncompany in particular.”\r\nBo rented a cheap apartment in Shanghai and hired a high\r\nschool classmate as his first employee—unemployed, his friend was\r\nthe only person he could afford. Unable to shell out on expensive\r\nengineers, he arranged for two employees of the Shanghai Electricity\r\nBureau, who had some IT experience but had never built a website,\r\nto moonlight for him. After 5 P.M., when they got off their shift at the\r\nelectricity utility, they came to the EachNet apartment and worked\r\nuntil 1 A.M., sleeping there before they clocked in back at their day job.\r\nSoon after, Bo convinced a fellow Shanghai-born Harvard Business\r\nSchool classmate, Tan Haiyin, to come on board as cofounder.\r\nBefore business school Tan had been one of the earliest employees\r\nof McKinsey in Shanghai. After Harvard she had taken a job at Merrill\r\nLynch in New York. She was traveling on a business trip in China\r\nwhen Bo called her up to ask her if she wanted to join him, and stay\r\nin China. She agreed.8\r\nBo attracted the attention of foreign media early on. The\r\nWashington Post quoted him vowing that EachNet would gain “even\r\ngreater dominance in China than eBay has achieved in the U.S.” Bo\r\nquickly commanded the attention of investors, too. The angel\r\ninvestment was followed swiftly by a $6.5 million venture round.9\r\nI got to know Bo soon after he returned to Shanghai. We were\r\nneighbors on Hengshan Road in the city’s former French concession\r\ndistrict. Despite his impeccable résumé, Bo lived modestly, moving in\r\nwith his parents. This was seized upon as a sign of his humility—\r\nalthough greater attention was given in local media to the fact that\r\nthis handsome, Harvard Business School returnee was still single.\r\nAlthough a relative latecomer to the China Internet scene, he\r\nmade an instant splash and moved to quickly outmaneuver his\r\nrivals.10 Bo doesn’t suffer fools gladly. In 2000, onstage at an Internet\r\nconference in Shanghai at which we were both speakers, Bo\r\ndemolished a rival who had just given a presentation stuffed with\r\ninflated website traffic and exaggerated transaction data. Bo calmly\r\nbut methodically exposed all of the flaws in the other presenter’s\r\nmath and logic, demolishing him so effectively that the audience\r\nalmost felt sorry for the hapless competitor, who did not ride out the\r\ndot-com bust.\r\nEachNet, by contrast, bucked the downturn and surprised\r\neveryone by securing a massive $20.5 million investment in October\r\n2000. The lead financier was Bernard Arnault, the French luxury\r\nbaron of LVMH, via his dot-com investment vehicle Europatweb. But\r\nas the market crashed the fund got cold feet and tried to pull out\r\nentirely; it finally ponied up $5 million. Bo demonstrated his\r\nconsiderable powers of persuasion by cobbling the remaining $15\r\nmillion from existing investors and others even as the public equity\r\nmarkets continued their downward slide. China was entering its\r\n“Internet winter,” but EachNet had gathered a large stack of acorns.\r\nYet making a viable business of EachNet would be no picnic for\r\nBo. Could the eBay model really work in China? In the United States,\r\neBay became popular for offering goods through online auctions, with\r\nthe transactions often taking place between consumers themselves.\r\nIn China, although people loved to haggle, the trading of secondhand\r\ngoods, even offline, wasn’t common. Shoppers were just beginning to\r\nexercise their newfound freedoms. Few people had many\r\npossessions to sell.\r\nIn the United States, eBay served an online population of more\r\nthan 100 million and could count on a well-developed credit card\r\nmarket and reliable nationwide courier services. In China, the muchvaunted\r\nonline consumer market of 10 million was a mirage. In 2000,\r\nit was too early to build an “iron triangle.” Few people could pay\r\nonline or access reliable delivery services. More fundamentally there\r\nwas a complete absence of trust in online shopping. Banking\r\nregulations restricted the development of credit cards, which were\r\nonly allowed in 1999, their use restricted to customers who kept\r\nmoney on deposit in their banks. Debit cards were beginning to gain\r\npopularity but each bank issued its own card and there was no\r\ncentral processing network for merchants. Forget about online\r\npayment—even buying offline with cards was a mess: Checkout\r\ncounters at the time were a tangle of cables, connecting or powering\r\na half-dozen individual point-of-sale (POS) machines. Online\r\npayment was years away from becoming widely accepted. Courier\r\nnetworks were restricted to individual cities: There was no “China\r\nmarket” to speak of, just a loose collection of local markets. The\r\nabsence of trust, though, was the biggest hurdle to greater consumer\r\ne-commerce adoption, as Bo described: “In the U.S., if you place a\r\nbid, it’s a contract, and by law you need to fulfill that bid if you win the\r\nauction. That’s very clear. People would be afraid of getting sued if\r\nthey did not abide by that contract. In China people don’t care. ‘I\r\nplace a bid, I don’t want it anymore, tough luck.’”\r\nIn response, EachNet limited its initial auction offerings to the city\r\nof Shanghai, where it had set up physical trading booths for\r\ncustomers to meet. Having first connected online, they would come to\r\nmeet one another in person to evaluate the goods on sale, ever\r\nmindful of being defrauded, then pay for the goods face-to-face.\r\nEachNet had to lease and operate multiple trading booths across\r\nShanghai, clearly not a sustainable strategy for a supposed Internet\r\nventure. By early 2001 they were all shut down.\r\nEachNet had to find new ways of making money, and so\r\nacquired a distributor of mobile phones and launched auction\r\nplatforms on NetEase and Sina. To broaden its appeal, EachNet\r\nstarted selling stamps and baby clothes.\r\nBut with no new VC funding at hand, Bo had no alternative but to\r\nfind a way to get around the roadblocks to online shopping: the\r\nproblems of payment, package delivery, product quality, and people’s\r\nconfidence.\r\nCombining payment and package delivery was one popular\r\nmethod. Cash on delivery allowed consumers to see before they\r\npaid. EachNet set up a system for courier companies to act as\r\ncollecting agents. Cash was a stopgap solution but by 2002 bank\r\ncards were finally becoming a viable payment option. China still had\r\nvery low credit card penetration but the use of debit cards was\r\nexploding. Bank cards grew from 150 million when EachNet was\r\nlaunched to almost half a billion cards by the end of 2002. The banks’\r\nIT systems also started to talk to one another, too, because in 2002\r\nChina’s banking regulator rolled out a unified card processing system\r\ncalled China UnionPay (zhongguo yinlian). UnionPay’s red, blue, and\r\ngreen logo is today a common sight in shop windows and on ATMs\r\naround the world. UnionPay solved a major headache for merchants\r\nin China, both offline and online, in making sure they could accept a\r\ncustomer’s card no matter which domestic bank had issued it. The\r\nprocess didn’t happen overnight, though, and for years EachNet\r\nencouraged its most active customers to apply for credit cards from\r\none of the big four commercial banks to ensure that they could\r\ncomplete their purchases online.\r\nAs Bo had pointed out, China’s legal system offered few\r\nprotections for merchants, who worried that customers wouldn’t pay\r\nfor goods already shipped, nor for customers, who were worried that\r\nthe goods they purchased might never arrive. To address this,\r\nEachNet set up its own escrow service, where it would collect funds\r\nfrom customers and release them only after delivery had been\r\nconfirmed, charging a 3 percent commission as a service fee. Few\r\ncustomers signed up, however, and with an eye on the success of\r\nPayPal in the United States, EachNet drew up plans for its own local\r\nequivalent.\r\nProduct quality issues were also tricky to overcome. In the\r\nStates, eBay had pioneered a system that allowed consumers to rate\r\nvendors, but in China unscrupulous vendors quickly figured out they\r\ncould game the system by using masses of fake accounts to drive up\r\ntheir positive ratings, or dilute their negatives. EachNet tried to limit\r\nthe number of ratings one user could post, and set up a team to\r\ninvestigate consumer complaints of fraud. But both efforts were\r\nrapidly overwhelmed. A key challenge was how to identify the buyers\r\nand sellers on its platform, never mind implementing any sanctions.\r\nEachNet clearly was in for a long haul, not projecting any profits\r\nuntil 2005. EachNet’s prospects of raising new venture capital\r\ninvestment dimmed further. Bo and his investors realized that their\r\nbest shot at making EachNet the eBay of China was to sell out to\r\neBay itself.\r\neBay Comes to China\r\nIn the fall of 2001, eBay CEO Meg Whitman made a trip to Shanghai\r\nto meet Bo. In March 2002, EachNet once again surprised the market\r\nwith a landmark deal, announcing it was selling a 33 percent stake to\r\neBay for $30 million.\r\nDespite EachNet’s challenges, eBay had been impressed by\r\nwhat it saw. The EachNet website had more than three million\r\nregistered users, of which over 100,000 visited the site each day. The\r\ncompany had expanded from Shanghai to Beijing and Guangzhou.\r\nMore than half of its business involved a party outside one of these\r\ncities. The site featured more than 50,000 items at any time, ranging\r\nfrom clothing to real estate, and offered by fixed prices or via\r\nauctions. Transactions exceeded $2 million a month.\r\nEachNet was tiny compared to eBay. But the allure of China was\r\nof critical importance to Whitman. She badly needed some good\r\nnews to reassure investors after announcing just one month earlier\r\nthe loss of the Japanese market to Yahoo Japan, backed by\r\nMasayoshi Son’s SoftBank, a blow to Whitman’s ambition to build\r\neBay as a “truly global marketplace.” From $750 million in 2001, eBay\r\nwas targeting $3 billion global revenue by 2005. Japan would have\r\nbeen a big step in achieving this, with more than $1.6 billion in goods\r\ntraded, but eBay was late11 to the party there, launching only in\r\nFebruary 2000, five months after Yahoo Japan. eBay’s strategy was a\r\nmess from the start. In Japan, eBay charged commissions but its\r\ncompetitor Yahoo Japan did not. Credit cards were still a rarity in\r\nJapan but eBay required customers to use them to register on its site.\r\neBay chose a Japanese CEO and a local partner (NEC) with little\r\nexperience of the Internet, charting a rapid course for irrelevance in\r\nthe country. By the summer of 2001 it had garnered a measly 3\r\npercent of the market. When in February 2002 eBay pulled the plug,\r\nits site offered just 25,000 products, compared to the 3.5 million on\r\noffer from its rival Yahoo Japan. In the Land of the Rising Sun, the\r\nsun had already set on eBay’s ambitions and the company laid off its\r\nstaff.\r\nWhere next? eBay had more success in South Korea12 and\r\nTaiwan,13 but only China could really move the needle. By 2002,\r\nChina’s Internet population had grown to over 27 million, the world’s\r\nfifth largest.14 Whitman was earlier than many in Silicon Valley to\r\nrecognize the importance of China: “With the demographics and\r\nincredible changes in China, our hypothesis is this could be one of\r\nthe largest e-commerce markets in the world,” she told the media,\r\nprojecting $16 billion in e-commerce revenue by 2006.\r\neBay had failed to understand the needs of local customers in\r\nJapan but Whitman was determined not to repeat the experience in\r\nChina. They wanted to back a leading player in the local market.\r\nEachNet was an obvious target. eBay senior vice president Bill Cobb\r\nlater commented, “[Bo] had studied eBay up one side and down the\r\nother and had really tried to adapt a lot of the eBay principles to the\r\nmarket.” It didn’t hurt of course that Bo (and his cofounder, Tan\r\nHaiyin) had both attended Harvard Business School, Meg Whitman’s\r\nalma mater.\r\nYet eBay didn’t just want to back EachNet; it wanted to buy it.\r\nThe initial deal15 gave eBay one-third of the company but also an\r\noption to take full control, which it did just fifteen months later, taking\r\nits total outlay to $180 million. Rebranded eBay EachNet, the\r\ncompany became a vessel for eBay’s China aspirations. The decision\r\nto own EachNet outright set the stage for Alibaba’s triumph, and\r\neBay’s humiliation.16\r\nThings looked good at the outset. With EachNet, eBay gained a\r\n90 percent share of China’s consumer e-commerce market. But\r\nwithin two years eBay was reduced to irrelevance in China and forced\r\nto beat another embarrassing retreat from Asia.\r\nWhy did things go so wrong so fast? Even though Whitman had\r\ngranted Bo a generous allocation of options, making EachNet a\r\nsubsidiary inevitably changed the dynamics with managers at eBay.\r\nSoon after the acquisition, for family reasons Bo had to move to\r\nCalifornia, which Meg Whitman was very generous in facilitating, as\r\nBo had recounted to me in 2015. He stayed involved in the business,\r\nbut the long distance between San Jose and Shanghai started to\r\nshow. With Bo no longer in Shanghai, the head of marketing in the\r\nUnited States began to tell marketing in China what to do, and the\r\nhead of technology did the same.\r\nWith the acquisition, eBay had dented EachNet’s entrepreneurial\r\nculture. The damage was revealed when another entrepreneurial\r\ncompany arrived on the scene: Alibaba. Worse still, Alibaba had the\r\nbacking of SoftBank, the author of eBay’s defeat at the hands of\r\nYahoo Japan.\r\nOne senior EachNet engineer, who would soldier on for several\r\nyears after the acquisition, summed up the critical problem: “eBay\r\nthought it was a done deal, but it turned out it was not.” eBay had a\r\nleading position at the outset, but the market was growing so fast that\r\nall that really mattered was grabbing the dominant share of the\r\nmillions of new online shoppers. Incremental users, not incumbency,\r\nwas the name of the game.\r\nIn his B2B business Alibaba.com, Jack had trained his firepower\r\non Merle Hinrichs at Global Sources. For his new consumer ecommerce\r\nventure, Jack set his sights on a much bigger target, an\r\nicon of Silicon Valley: eBay and its CEO Meg Whitman.\r\nSquaring Off\r\nAlibaba launched its preparations to enter China’s consumer ecommerce\r\nmarket in 2002, initially as a defensive move sparked by\r\neBay’s entry. As Jack later explained, “I needed to stop eBay to\r\nprotect Alibaba.” Although EachNet was targeting consumers, not the\r\nbusinesses served by Alibaba, Jack was concerned that some of the\r\nlarger merchants active on EachNet could encroach on Alibaba’s turf:\r\n“At that time, there were only two companies in China that\r\nunderstood online marketplaces, eBay and Alibaba. I was particularly\r\nconcerned that eBay’s power sellers would grow their business to\r\ncompete in the B2B space.”\r\nJack’s plans to target consumers encountered resistance within\r\nAlibaba. The B2B business wasn’t yet profitable, and the VC market\r\nwas closed for the time being. Could the company really afford to\r\nopen a new front when they were still fighting the B2B battle? Was\r\nJack just being paranoid?\r\nCTO John Wu adamantly opposed the idea, visiting Jack the\r\nnight before the new project was kicked off. John warned Jack that\r\nthe move would harm Alibaba: “How on earth could you fight against\r\neBay?” Jack replied that the market was still open: “There are one\r\nhundred million Internet users today, but only five million people are\r\ndoing online shopping.” Jack’s ambitious plans for Alibaba also gave\r\nhim a different perspective: “eBay wants to buy the Chinese market,\r\nbut we want to create China’s Internet trading market.”\r\nWith his firsthand experience as a small-business owner in\r\nZhejiang, Jack was adamant that the threat from eBay was real: “In\r\nChina, there are so many small businesses that people don’t make a\r\nclear distinction between business and consumer. Small business\r\nand consumer behavior are very similar. One person makes the\r\ndecisions for the whole organization.” Jack also understood the\r\ntemptation for eBay, later reflecting, “We launched Taobao not to\r\nmake money, but because in the U.S. eBay gets a lot of its revenue\r\nfrom small businesses. We knew that someday eBay would come in\r\nour direction.”\r\nSo it was decided. Alibaba would target the consumer ecommerce\r\nmarket. Jack was emboldened after a trip at the end of\r\n2002 to Tokyo, where he found Masayoshi Son in a buoyant mood.\r\nYahoo Japan had just repelled eBay from its shores, boosting\r\nSoftBank’s standing after several painful years of dot-com writedowns.\r\nSoftBank signed up to commit $80 million17 to Alibaba’s new\r\nventure.\r\nThe project was kept highly confidential. Few within Alibaba were\r\neven aware that the idea of targeting consumers in China had been\r\ncontemplated, let alone that a team had actually been formed to code\r\na new website. Secrecy, and some useful Alibaba folklore, was\r\nachieved by sequestering a handful of employees, including Alibaba\r\ncofounder Toto Sun, in the original Lakeside apartment where Alibaba\r\nhad been founded.\r\nTwo years later Jack recalled the scene as he invited a halfdozen,\r\nhandpicked employees to his office: “Our COO, CFO, the vice\r\npresident of HR, and I were all there. We talked to them one by one:\r\n‘The company has decided to send you to do a project, but you are\r\nrequired to leave your home, and you must not tell your parents or\r\nyour boyfriend or your girlfriend. Do you agree?’” Holed up in the\r\nsmall apartment, the team got to work.\r\nIn taking on eBay, Jack wanted to preserve the element of\r\nsurprise. Explaining his strategy, he dipped into his reservoir of\r\nmartial arts stories: “I’ve seen lots of people yelling ‘Fight the Shaolin\r\nTemple!’ at the foot of the Shaolin Temple; that’s complete nonsense.\r\nHowever, if I reach your doorstep to challenge you, I pretty much\r\nknow that I will defeat you. In the future there will be no need to yell;\r\nas soon as you stand on the doorstep, people will be scared.”\r\nThroughout the project, Jack emphasized that their target was\r\nnot EachNet but eBay itself. Once the project became public\r\nknowledge, he wanted to ensure the fight was seen as a David\r\nversus Goliath struggle. One team member18 recalled the mood: “We\r\nwere just a group of country bumpkins, and our competitor was\r\neBay.” Reuters later summed up the culture as “kung fu commerce\r\nwith a dash of theater.”\r\nTo keep up morale the small group of software engineers took\r\nbreaks between coding to play video games or do exercises. Jack\r\nencouraged the team to do handstands. As a child, he explained,\r\nlooking at the world upside down had given him a different\r\nperspective on life.\r\nThe new business was to be named19 “hunting for treasure,” or\r\ntaobao in Chinese. Taobao.com’s tagline was “There is no treasure\r\nthat cannot be hunted out, and there is no treasure that cannot be\r\nsold.”\r\nTaobao was officially launched on May 10, 2003, celebrated\r\neach year as “Aliday,” a “take your family to work” day and the date of\r\nthe company’s famous group wedding celebration. Aliday celebrates\r\nthe team spirit that helped Alibaba overcome an unexpected\r\nchallenge that tested its employees as never before.\r\nSARS Attacks\r\nThe SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus outbreak\r\nstarted in southern China in 2002, spreading to create clusters of\r\ninfection around the world that caused eight thousand people to fall\r\nsick as well as almost eight hundred deaths. Seven thousand of\r\nthose infected, and most of those who died, were located in mainland\r\nChina and Hong Kong.\r\nIn Hangzhou, four hundred employees in Alibaba’s head office\r\nunderwent voluntary isolation at home after one of their colleagues,\r\nKitty Song (Song Jie), fell ill with a suspected case of SARS. She had\r\ntraveled to Guangzhou, the epicenter of the outbreak, as part of an\r\nAlibaba team participating in the biannual Canton Fair.\r\nSARS bound an already close company even closer. Because its\r\norigins and full impact were unknown, SARS was a frightening\r\nexperience—as I experienced myself in Beijing at the time. The\r\noutbreak also bound people together.\r\nIn early May, Jack donned one of the face masks that the\r\ncompany had distributed to all its employees and initiated a plan that\r\nconfined all of its employees at home for one week. Soon after they\r\nwere sent home, Alibaba’s office was sealed off to avoid any risk of\r\ninfections from exposure to the suspected case. In a letter to\r\nemployees distributed that day, Jack’s ability to inspire the troops,\r\nand to keep them focused on the company’s goals, was on full\r\ndisplay: “We care for each other and we support each other. We\r\nnever forget the mission and obligation of Alibaba, in face of the\r\nchallenge from SARS. Tragedy will pass, but life will continue.\r\nFighting with catastrophe cannot prevent us from fighting for the\r\nenterprise we love.”\r\nAlthough it sickened thousands and killed almost eight hundred\r\npeople, the outbreak had a curiously beneficial impact on the Chinese\r\nInternet sector, including Alibaba. SARS validated digital mobile\r\ntelephony and the Internet, and so came to represent the turning\r\npoint when the Internet emerged as a truly mass medium in China.\r\nThe virus gave a major boost to texting, which increased\r\nbusiness for cellular companies like China Mobile. However, SARS\r\nalso boosted the three Chinese Internet portals thanks to revenuesharing\r\nagreements with the telecom company. As the shares in\r\nSina, Sohu, and NetEase began to climb, investor interest in Chinese\r\ntechnology companies was suddenly reignited. Cell phone usage\r\nwasn’t the only thing to benefit; broadband Internet access got a huge\r\nlift, too, as millions of people, confined to their homes or dormitories\r\nfor days or weeks on end, looked to the Internet for information or\r\nentertainment.\r\nWithin days of home confinement, Alibaba employees had\r\nInternet connections installed at home. While the Hangzhou\r\nauthorities supplied food and twice-daily disinfection visits,\r\nemployees continued their work, holding virtual meetings in online\r\nchat rooms.\r\nReliable information about SARS was hard to come by,\r\nespecially in the early months of the outbreak, when China’s official\r\nmedia, including state broadcaster China Central Television, stayed\r\nmute. Instead people looked to their cell phones and PCs to learn\r\nabout the virus and the best ways to protect themselves. Crucially for\r\nAlibaba, SARS convinced millions of people, afraid to go outside, to\r\ntry shopping online instead.\r\nThe suspected case of SARS within the company turned out not\r\nto be infected by the virus after all, and so for Alibaba, SARS ended\r\nup a blessing in disguise. Because the Taobao stealth team had\r\nrelocated to work in the Lakeside apartment, they were not affected\r\nby the quarantine of the main office. Jack was still confined at home\r\nand unable to join the Taobao team for the May 10 launch, as he later\r\nrecalled, “A few of us agreed to talk on the phone at eight P.M. and\r\nraised our glasses in the air and said ‘Wishing Taobao a safe\r\njourney.’ The day that Taobao was launched there was a line on the\r\nwebsite that declared, ‘Remembering those who worked hard during\r\nSARS.’”\r\nDuring the SARS outbreak, Alibaba employees self-quarantined and worked from home,\r\n2003. Alibaba\r\nTaobao\r\nAlthough Taobao was launched on May 10, visitors to the website\r\ncould not discern any connection with Alibaba. Taobao made a virtue\r\nof its start-up status by relying on word-of-mouth marketing to\r\npopularize the site, including postings on the many free bulletin board\r\nsystems and other online forums popular in China at the time.\r\nTaobao’s association with Alibaba was kept so well hidden that a\r\nnumber of Alibaba employees even voiced concerns to management\r\nabout a potential new rival on the scene. Jack recalled, “We have a\r\nvery active intranet. In late June, someone posted a message asking\r\nthe company’s senior management to pay attention to one website,\r\nwhich might become our competitor in the future.” Soon the Alibaba\r\nintranet was alive with discussions about who was behind Taobao,\r\nand employees commenting on the disappearance of some of their\r\ncolleagues. Finally, on July 10, 2003, Alibaba announced that Taobao\r\nwas part of the company. “There was a resounding cheer within the\r\ncompany,” Jack recalled.\r\nThe cat was out of the bag, and with the full resources of Alibaba\r\nat its disposal Taobao was now free to take on eBay. Yet Jack wanted\r\nTaobao to maintain an innovative, start-up culture, something aided\r\nby a preemptive move by eBay to try to sew up the market. eBay\r\nsigned exclusive advertising contracts to promote its site on all the\r\nmajor China Internet portals, preventing them from displaying ads\r\npromoting rival sites. This forced Alibaba to adopt a series of guerrilla\r\nmarketing techniques, including reaching out to hundreds of small but\r\nfast-growing sites and online communities that eBay had deemed\r\nunimportant.\r\nWith the backing of SoftBank, Jack took a move from Yahoo\r\nJapan’s playbook. In 1999, when it launched its e-commerce\r\nbusiness, CEO Masahiro Inoue asked his 120 employees to list items\r\nfor sale on his new site to make it look active and popular. Four years\r\nlater in China, Jack did the same: “We had all together seven, eight\r\npeople [in the Taobao team]. . . . Everyone had to find four items. I\r\nrummaged through my chests and cupboards. I barely had anything\r\nat home. . . . We pooled about thirty items, and I bought yours and\r\nyou bought mine, that’s how it started. . . . I even listed my watch\r\nonline.”\r\nJack also insisted that Taobao maintain a distinctively local\r\nculture, including choosing nicknames20 from Jin Yong’s novels or\r\nother popular tales. Taobao was successful at developing a whimsical\r\nculture and instilling a strong sense of teamwork. Yet it would be\r\nyears before Taobao would make any money. Fortunately, Alibaba\r\ncould count on SoftBank’s support once again. In February 2004,\r\nSoftBank led a new $82 million investment to replenish Alibaba’s\r\ncoffers, in preparation for Taobao’s long battle with eBay.\r\nThis transaction also was the end of the road for Goldman\r\nSachs. Shirley Lin had left the bank in May 2003. With no one to\r\noversee the stake, Goldman had written down the value of its stake to\r\nzero. The following year, just before the new investment led by\r\nSoftBank, Goldman sold off its entire 33 percent stake. The bank had\r\npaid $3.3 million for it in 1999 and sold it for more than seven times\r\nthat amount five years later. This seemed like a good result at the\r\ntime, although no one involved with the deal still remained at\r\nGoldman to take any credit. The investors who bought out the stake\r\nsaw an immediate appreciation once SoftBank anted up more funds\r\nfor Taobao. Worse was to come for Goldman, though, when in 2014\r\nthe full extent of the mistake sank in. The stake the investment bank\r\nhad paid $3.3 million for in 1999 would rise in value to more than\r\n$12.5 billion at the IPO had they held on to it. Worse still, the partners\r\nat the bank could calculate how much they personally had forgone.\r\nSome calculated their missed windfall at more than $400 million,\r\nquite a few mansions in the Hamptons.\r\nAlong with SoftBank, other investors committing fresh funding to\r\nAlibaba included Fidelity Investments, Venture TDF, and new investor\r\nGranite Global Ventures (later known as GGV Capital), backed by\r\nRockefeller affiliate Venrock. The deal was announced as part of a\r\nmove to “aggressively expand” Taobao to make it the “most popular\r\nonline marketplace for Chinese retailers and individuals to list their\r\nproducts on the Internet.”\r\nMasayoshi Son publicly endorsed Alibaba’s strategy. Four years\r\nafter SoftBank’s initial investment in Alibaba, he declared himself\r\n“extremely pleased” and predicted that “Alibaba has the potential to\r\nbecome another extraordinary success like Yahoo.” Meanwhile,\r\nAlibaba disclosed that revenues from its Alibaba.com B2B site had\r\ngrown threefold in the previous year, propelling that business at last\r\nto profitability.\r\nDespite the fresh backing for Taobao, eBay itself remained\r\noblivious to the rising threat, considering itself far superior to this\r\nquirky, local rival. When asked by BusinessWeek in the spring of\r\n2004 about rivals in China, eBay’s senior vice president Bill Cobb\r\nmentioned only one: 1Pai, a joint venture between Yahoo and Sina.\r\nJack reveled in being ignored. “During the first year, eBay didn’t\r\nconsider us their rival. They didn’t even think that we could be their\r\nrival. They thought, We haven’t even heard about Alibaba. Such a\r\nstrange name. Chinese all know what tao bao means, foreigners\r\ndon’t.”\r\neBay was confident that its global network and experience would\r\nensure EachNet pulled well clear of any competitors. But corporate\r\nbureaucracy, worsened by the extended and dysfunctional reporting\r\nlines all the way to San Jose, were to smother whatever embers of\r\nentrepreneurialism still burned within EachNet in Shanghai. eBay’s\r\nChina adventure, lasting from 2003 to 2006, is today a case study in\r\nhow not to go about managing a business in a distant market.\r\neBay’s first big mistake was to tell the market that China was\r\nalready an ace in the hole. Meg Whitman deserves credit for\r\nrecognizing China’s potential as an Internet market before that was\r\npopular. Her early interest in business opportunities in China was\r\nsparked by a family connection to the country: “In the 1970s my mom\r\nwas invited to be part of group of women, led by actress Shirley\r\nMacLaine, to visit China. There were lots of reasons not to go: China\r\nwas then an undeveloped country that had been closed to outsiders\r\nfor many years. And my mom had just ten days to get ready. But\r\ninstead of worrying about her safety, she seized the chance to have\r\nan adventure. Over four weeks, the group covered two thousand\r\nmiles in China, mostly by train, visiting schools, farms, and villages.”\r\nWhitman recalled that the trip “changed my mother’s life and,\r\nindirectly, mine, too. My mom learned Mandarin in subsequent years\r\nand returned to China eighty times. And after her first trip, she told my\r\nsister and me, ‘I’ve seen women doing all sorts of marvelous things—\r\nso realize you have the opportunity to do and be anything you want.’”\r\nMary Meeker, then an Internet analyst at Morgan Stanley, where\r\nshe was dubbed the “Queen of the Internet,”21 was one of Meg\r\nWhitman’s lead cheerleaders. The dot-com bust had dented the\r\nreputation of nearly the entire Wall Street tech research community,\r\nbut China played a big role in Meeker’s redemption. In April 2004,\r\nMorgan Stanley released a 217-page report under her name that\r\nprofiled the Chinese Internet sector. It would be reprinted more than\r\ntwenty-five thousand times. Meeker had a reputation for being a\r\ncontrarian: “One of the greatest investments of our lifetime has been\r\nNew York City real estate,” she said, “and investors made the highest\r\nreturns when they bought stuff during the 1970s and 1980s when\r\npeople were getting mugged. . . . The lesson is that you make the\r\nmost money when you buy stuff that’s out of consensus.”\r\nWhoever Wins China, Wins the World\r\nMeeker now saw China as the Next Big Thing. Picking the right\r\nChinese company to bet on wasn’t easy, Meeker said, so she\r\nrecommended instead that investors leverage Silicon Valley\r\ncompanies with exposure to China: “Both Yahoo and eBay have\r\ninteresting plays in the Chinese market. So our simplistic point of\r\nview is that one way to play the Chinese market is by owning Yahoo\r\nor eBay.” The report quoted Whitman, raising the stakes, as\r\npredicting, “Whoever wins China, will win the world.”\r\nMeeker’s vocal support for Whitman, including cheering on her\r\nChina strategy, helped boost eBay’s share price by 80 percent in\r\n2004. But the climbing valuation obscured growing challenges for the\r\ncompany. A series of hikes in commissions sparked protests from its\r\nvirtual store merchants, tens of thousands clubbing together to\r\ndenounce “FeeBay” or “GreedBay.” Complaints reached a crescendo\r\nin February 2005 when eBay increased commissions by almost 3\r\npercent (to 8 percent) on its worldwide mall. Whitman remained\r\nsanguine. “The thing to know about the eBay community . . . is that\r\nit’s been vocal from Day One.” She did concede, however, that the\r\ndissatisfied merchants had “perhaps been a tad more vocal than in\r\nthe past.”\r\nChina became a useful way of distracting eBay’s investors from\r\nproblems at home. Worse, before the company had even secured its\r\nposition there, a “we’re winning in China” attitude, at both eBay and\r\nits newly acquired business, PayPal, ensured a form of collective\r\ndenial even when confronted with signs that things were not going to\r\nplan. China was considered so important that managers, keen to\r\npresent a positive story to Whitman and other senior executives,\r\nmade sure that everything looked great on PowerPoint and sounded\r\nsmooth on conference calls. But thanks to its own missteps as well as\r\nAlibaba’s competitive moves, this was increasingly at odds with the\r\nfacts on the ground.\r\neBay’s biggest mistake was in getting the culture wrong. A “leave\r\nit to the experts” attitude demoralized the original EachNet team in\r\nShanghai, as eBay executives were parachuted in from headquarters\r\nin San Jose or other parts of the eBay empire. No matter how skilled\r\nthe new arrivals, most spoke no Chinese. They faced a steep\r\nlearning curve to understand the local market. Key EachNet team\r\nmembers started to leave, their exit interviews revealing concerns\r\nthat San Jose no longer involved them in key decisions. eBay had\r\nsent over a number of China-born executives, but most had studied\r\nor worked in the United States for many years, sparking\r\nmisunderstandings or friction with the local team. EachNet found itself\r\nat a serious disadvantage to the 100 percent local Taobao.\r\nThis gap was reflected in the design of the two rivals’ websites.\r\neBay moved quickly to align the EachNet site with its global site,\r\nrevamping how products were categorized and altering the design\r\nand functionality of the website. This not only confused customers,\r\nbut also alienated a number of important merchants who saw their\r\npreviously valuable China account names had been deleted. This\r\ninvalidated their trading history and forced them to scramble to\r\nreapply for new names on an unfamiliar global platform. Worse still,\r\nthe Chinese website lacked a customer service telephone number.\r\neBay’s China site, modeled closely on eBay in the States, looked\r\nforeign to local users, who found it “empty” when compared to local\r\nsites.\r\nIn website design, culture matters. In the West, websites like\r\nGoogle had become popular for their clean lines and uncluttered\r\n“negative space.” But to the mass market of Chinese Web users,\r\naccustomed to pop-ups and floating banner ads, they seemed static\r\nand dull. As you can see for yourself by opening taobao.com,\r\nsuccessful Chinese websites are typically packed with information\r\nand multimedia graphics, requiring many scroll-downs to see the\r\nwhole page. From its outset Taobao has been a website built by\r\nChinese for Chinese. And it worked.\r\nIt’s not just the graphics that helped Taobao connect with\r\nconsumers. Taobao structured its website like a local bazaar, even\r\nfeaturing innovative ideas such as allowing male or female shoppers\r\nto click on a button to display products most suited to their interests.\r\nThe design of the site makes it the virtual descendant of the Yiwu\r\nwholesale market, where Jack and many other Zhejiang\r\nentrepreneurs draw their inspiration. The founder of another, niche ecommerce\r\nventure explained, “If you go to Yiwu, you can order as\r\nlittle as three pairs of shoes. One factory specializes in soles, another\r\nin the uppers, another factory—or perhaps a small village—\r\nspecializes in the laces. Taobao tapped the motivation of those small\r\nmerchants to make money.”\r\nFor companies like eBay and Amazon, their experience in the\r\nUnited States and other Western markets proved to be of little use.\r\n“E-commerce in China is very strange,” the rival e-commerce founder\r\ncontinued. “It started with C2C (consumer-to-consumer) and with\r\nnonstandardized products. This was unlike Amazon, unlike the\r\nconventional wisdom where you need to start with standardized\r\nproducts, like books. The more standardized the supply chain, the\r\nhigher the barriers for e-tailers. All the smaller, mom-and-pop stores\r\nselling nonstandardized products are more accommodating, more\r\nflexible in supplying goods. That’s unique to China. The lack of\r\nnational supply chains removed the barriers to entry that exist in the\r\nWest, making it possible for individuals to make money.22 By starting\r\nwith C2C, it made the price factor very appealing. Individuals23 can\r\nbe happy to make even five mao (less than 1 U.S. cent) on a sale.”\r\nAgain aided by its roots in Zhejiang, Taobao outsmarted eBay by\r\nhaving a better understanding of the country’s merchants, for whom\r\nmembership has been free of charge from the outset. Just as free\r\nlistings was a core principle for the B2B Alibaba.com, it became a key\r\ncompetitive weapon for Taobao.com, too. Buyers pay nothing to\r\nregister or transact; sellers pay nothing to register, list their products,\r\nor sell online.\r\nEachNet had started out with free listings, but faced with\r\nspiraling costs in August 2001, it started to charge listing fees to\r\nsellers, adding commissions on all transactions the following year.\r\nThese resulted in a sharp reduction in the number of auctions on the\r\nsite, but given the state of the VC markets, EachNet management felt\r\nthey had no choice. The decision to start charging fees, core to\r\neBay’s model, ironically fueled its interest in buying EachNet. But\r\nonce eBay was in charge in China, it pushed the fee culture much\r\nmore aggressively than Bo and his team. eBay’s vice president for\r\nglobal marketing, Bill Cobb, summed it up:24 “We’re mainly interested\r\nin making sure that we structure this to have long-term sustainability.\r\nWe have the essential eBay format—the insertion fees, final-value\r\nfees, and features fees—though at a lower level.”\r\nMeanwhile, Taobao’s decision to forgo charging fees was not\r\nwithout risk, since it forced it to look to other ways of generating\r\nrevenues, especially if the site became popular and drove up\r\noperating costs. But making the site free for both shoppers and\r\nmerchants turned out to be the key factor in ensuring Taobao’s\r\ntriumph over eBay. A research paper25 that analyzed more than a\r\ndecade’s worth of transaction data on Taobao concludes26 that in the\r\nearly phase of the company’s history, attracting merchants, who in\r\nChina are especially allergic to paying fees, was more important than\r\nattracting shoppers. Taobao’s popularity was fueled by a “virtuous\r\ncircle”: More merchants and product listings meant more shoppers\r\nwere attracted to the site, which meant more merchants and\r\nproducts, etc.\r\nIn addition to being popular with consumers, offering free\r\nservices ensured that Taobao was not distracted by a persistent\r\nproblem that plagued EachNet from the beginning: worrying about\r\nhow to prevent vendors and consumers from figuring out ways to use\r\nthe website simply as a place to connect with one another, then\r\nconducting their transactions offline or through other means. As\r\nTaobao charged no fees, they had no incentive to police this\r\nbehavior. On the contrary, Taobao actively encouraged\r\ncommunications between the transacting parties by setting up bulletin\r\nboards and, beginning in June 2004, launching an embedded,\r\nproprietary chat window with the unfortunately in English named\r\nAliWangwang.27 Buyers on the site use the service to haggle with\r\nsellers, which resonates well with the vibrant marketplace culture in\r\nChina. Communication is a key underpinning of commerce, but eBay\r\nusers struggled to communicate with vendors.\r\nDesigned with input from Taobao users, AliWangwang is an early\r\nexample of the type of “consumer-driven innovation” that drives\r\nsuccessful technology firms in China today, such as the role that cell\r\nphone vendor Xiaomi’s fan club plays in suggesting new product\r\nfeatures.\r\nTo this day, AliWangwang remains a popular feature on Taobao,\r\nallowing consumers to maintain their own list of personal purveyors—\r\none, say, for cosmetics, another for baby formula—who are at their\r\nbeck and call around the clock. Customer service on Taobao is so\r\ngood that it can be overwhelming. A purchase on Taobao is often\r\naccompanied by a flurry of messages on AliWangwang, a series of\r\nvirtual bows and scrapes from merchant to customer, who may have\r\na hard time exiting the conversation.\r\nBut whatever the “pull” of Taobao, a decision by eBay in\r\nSeptember 2004 would serve to “push” many of EachNet’s customers\r\naway. eBay executives in San Jose decided to “migrate” the China\r\nwebsite to the United States. Instead of hosting the website close to\r\ncustomers in China, it was shifted to the States. In a borderless\r\nInternet, where a website is hosted shouldn’t matter. But China’s is\r\nnot a borderless Internet. Today the Chinese government is actively\r\npromoting its vision of “Internet sovereignty” around the world: a\r\nrejection of the idea that a nation-state’s virtual borders should be\r\nless meaningful than its actual frontiers. In China, the effects of the\r\ngovernment’s long-standing efforts to build and extend the “Great\r\nFirewall of China” often means websites hosted overseas are much\r\nslower to load than those hosted in China itself. All Web traffic\r\naccessing sites hosted outside the mainland has to go through a\r\nseries of chokepoints where the request is screened. This is to\r\nensure that a foreign website does not display material the Chinese\r\ngovernment deems “sensitive,” including the “three T’s” (Tibet,\r\nTaiwan, and Tiananmen Square). These and other sensitive topics,\r\nsuch as unrest in Xinjiang, are widely thought to have been the\r\nreason that China has blocked some of the world’s leading websites,\r\nfrom Twitter to YouTube to Facebook and, increasingly, Google.\r\nWhile e-commerce and online shopping typically don’t touch on\r\nthese sensitive areas, the Great Firewall can often ensnare or\r\nseemingly block even anodyne activities or requests. For example,\r\nonce eBay had moved its servers outside China, a user who\r\nhappened to have a “64” or an “89” as part of his or her username\r\nmight see their account blocked or be unable to access the Internet—\r\nthe reason being that both numbers automatically trigger the censors\r\nin China as part of the effort to block any mentions of the events in\r\nTiananmen Square on June 4, 1989 (6/4/89).\r\neBay had its reasons for the migration. As the business grew in\r\nChina, the engineers in San Jose worried whether the platform built\r\nby a Shanghai-based start-up could cope. It turned out that EachNet\r\nhad built robust technology, capable of scaling up by even a hundred\r\ntimes. But after a series of site outages that had damaged its\r\nreputation at home, eBay had become obsessed with the stability of\r\nits platform. eBay pushed ahead with the China migration anyway.\r\nThe attraction of a unified worldwide site with a consistent set of\r\nfeatures was just too hard to resist.\r\nSome senior executives within eBay already knew that migration\r\nwould be a mistake—the company had already seen the damaging\r\nimpact in Taiwan—but bizarrely eBay managers in Taipei were\r\nblocked by migration-obsessed managers in San Jose from sharing\r\ntheir experience with the team in Shanghai.\r\nAs predicted, as soon as the China site was migrated and\r\nintegrated into the global site, the impact on EachNet’s traffic was\r\ndisastrous: It dropped off precipitously. Customers in China started to\r\nexperience long delays and time-outs on the site. Why would they\r\nbother to wait for eBay in China—a site that charged fees—when\r\nTaobao was available instantly and for free?\r\nMigration was also costly for eBay because the company\r\ntypically carried out maintenance of its servers every Thursday at\r\nmidnight on the West Coast, ahead of the peak traffic of Friday. But\r\nthis meant the disruption happened at the peak of China traffic, fifteen\r\nhours ahead of San Jose. EachNet tried to adjust the maintenance\r\nschedule but with no success.\r\nMeg Whitman had made China a key priority for eBay. But when\r\nmigration caused traffic in China to plummet, no one told her. She\r\nfound out only a month later on a visit to Shanghai, and she was\r\nfurious at not having been kept informed.\r\nThings quickly spiraled out of control for the company in China.\r\nOnce the website had been migrated to the United States, all\r\nmodification requests from engineers in China were stacked up in\r\nwhat the company called a “train seat” system. Departments would\r\nsubmit their requests for changes, and like an assembly-line process\r\nthese were then lined up and consolidated into a “train of needs.”\r\nChanging one word on the site would take nine weeks. Changing one\r\nfeature would take one year.\r\nHow could eBay be so inefficient? There are two explanations.\r\nFirst, eBay had an effective monopoly in the States, and this bred\r\ncomplacency. Second, despite its Silicon Valley aura, eBay was never\r\nvery strong at technology. One eBay executive famously once said, in\r\npublic, “Even a monkey could run this business.” After the\r\nembarrassing site outages, stability and process trumped technology.\r\nOnce Taobao appeared on the scene, eBay’s “train seat” system\r\nquickly became a train wreck. EachNet executives desperately tried\r\nto signal the danger to senior executives in San Jose, but to no avail.\r\nAlthough Taobao had its merits, Alibaba could hardly believe its\r\nluck as the ineptness of this supposedly world-renowned company\r\nbecame apparent. Jack compared eBay’s lumbering approach to a\r\njumbo jet: “A global technology platform sounds great, like a Boeing\r\n747 flying is great. But if the airport is a school yard, you cannot land.\r\nEven if you want to change a button, you have to report to, like,\r\nfourteen guys.”\r\nLooking back on the fiasco eight years later in her new role as\r\nCEO of Hewlett-Packard, Meg Whitman was contrite about eBay’s\r\nmissteps in China. “You’ve got to have a set of products uniquely\r\ndesigned for this market by Chinese. It is not a market where you can\r\ntake a product or a system that works in Europe or the United States\r\nand export to China.”\r\nShe also concedes that migration was the fatal blow to eBay’s\r\nChina ambitions. “We made one big mistake. We should have left\r\nEachNet on their own platform in China. Instead what we did was put\r\nEachNet onto the global eBay platform because it had worked\r\neverywhere. It had worked in Western Europe, it had worked all over.\r\n. . . We had bought all these baby eBays and basically migrated them\r\nto one common platform, which had a lot of advantages. One is cost.\r\nSecond is speed to market, because when you roll ‘buy it now’ you\r\ncould roll it to thirty countries as opposed to do it incrementally. But\r\nwe made a mistake in China.”\r\nShe gives credit to Alibaba’s achievements in designing Taobao\r\nto suit the local market: “They had a uniquely Chinese platform—and\r\nby the way they didn’t charge anything for years and years and years\r\nand years—and they just outexecuted us.”\r\nAfter Bo stepped down, eBay struggled to find a replacement,\r\ngoing through a series of executives, from James Zheng to a\r\nTaiwanese-born American, Martin Wu, newly hired from Microsoft\r\nChina, who would last only twelve months.\r\nWhitman today rues the loss of the entrepreneur who had\r\nfounded EachNet: “What I would have done is left Bo Shao in charge\r\nand owned the thirty percent of China that we originally owned and let\r\nhim do his own thing.”\r\nSensing eBay’s disarray in China, Jack pushed ahead. At a fourhour\r\nsession in a stadium in Hangzhou in September 2004 to\r\ncelebrate Alibaba’s fifth birthday, Jack rallied all two thousand\r\nemployees of Alibaba, including the fast-growing Taobao team, who\r\nheld aloft flags emblazoned with worker ants, the mascot of Taobao.\r\nThe ant was chosen to symbolize how even the smallest creatures\r\ncan prevail over their enemies provided they work closely together.\r\nThe assembled masses then held hands and chanted a song, “True\r\nHeroes,” whose lyric “You have to go through a thunderstorm to see a\r\nrainbow, and no one can succeed easily” was a reference to the\r\nchallenge of SARS that they had overcome. This was followed by\r\n“The ants that unite can beat an elephant,” after which everyone\r\nheaded off to a disco, where Jack danced on the bar into the wee\r\nhours.\r\nThe elephant in the room was, of course, eBay. From the\r\nmoment he conceived of Taobao, Jack maintained a relentless focus\r\non the company. In a much-quoted analogy, Jack commented to\r\nForbes magazine in 2005, “eBay may be a shark in the ocean, but I\r\nam a crocodile in the Yangtze River. If we fight in the ocean, we lose,\r\nbut if we fight in the river, we win.”\r\nThe tide was turning against eBay. From a market share of more\r\nthan 90 percent in 2003, eBay’s market share fell by half the following\r\nyear—barely ahead of Taobao.\r\nAnd there was another problem for eBay: online payment.\r\nOn October 18, 2003, just five months after the launch of\r\nTaobao, Alibaba rolled out Alipay, its own payment solution. Although\r\nit was rudimentary, reminiscent of the early days of Alibaba’s\r\ncustomer log three years earlier, it proved an instant hit with\r\ncustomers.\r\nLucy Peng, a cofounder of Alibaba, is today CEO of Ant\r\nFinancial, the Alibaba affiliate that controls Alipay. In 2012, at a talk I\r\nmoderated for her at Stanford University, she reflected on the launch\r\nof the service: “The simple [escrow] model established a trust system\r\nin online shopping during its early stages. This was a very primitive\r\nmodel. . . . During Alipay’s initial operations one department had a fax\r\nmachine, after clients wired monies via banks or post offices, they\r\nhad to fax bank slips to Taobao. We would then double-check and\r\nconfirm.”\r\nIt would be three months before eBay woke up to the threat of\r\nAlipay. In January 2004, PayPal assembled a task force in San Jose\r\nto pick up on EachNet’s earlier unsuccessful efforts to devise an\r\nescrow solution.\r\nIn the United States, eBay had shelled out $1.4 billion to buy\r\nPayPal in 2002. But it was slow to integrate the company and roll it\r\nout to China. To be fair to PayPal, regulatory obstacles in China were\r\nan important factor in the delay: The country’s banking sector is\r\nclosely guarded by the government. Also, China’s currency is not\r\nfreely convertible, meaning that foreign payment providers are\r\nbanned from facilitating international transactions or offering credit.\r\nPayPal struggled to come up with workarounds to these challenges,\r\nincluding local partnerships.\r\nPayPal had started out in the United States as a huge risk taker,\r\nlegendary for its swashbuckling founders and early executives, today\r\noften referred to as the “PayPal mafia”: Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman\r\n(cofounder of LinkedIn), and, after they bought his payments\r\ncompany, Elon Musk (Tesla Motors, SpaceX, SolarCity). But within\r\neBay, and far from home, PayPal would struggle in China from the\r\noutset.\r\nAttempts to figure out a way forward for the company in China\r\nwere complicated when PayPal was sued for alleged patent\r\ninfringement in the United States by AT&T, causing new work on\r\nescrow solutions to grind to a halt. To keep momentum on solving the\r\nChina problem, eBay’s newly established China Development Center\r\ninitiated its own proposed escrow product, called An Fu Tong (AFT).\r\nThe idea was that while PayPal was tied up with the lawsuit in the\r\nStates, AFT could be deployed as a stopgap solution. Finally, in\r\nDecember 2004, eBay could provide an answer to Alipay and\r\ndeployed AFT in China. But by then PayPal had resolved the AT&T\r\nlawsuit and wanted to deploy its own solution, not AFT. Meanwhile,\r\nAlibaba hadn’t been standing still, rolling out a steady stream of\r\nimprovements to Alipay including popular text message notifications\r\nto inform customers of successful payments and, working with\r\ndomestic logistics companies, shipments as well. Alibaba’s “iron\r\ntriangle” was beginning to take shape.\r\nFor Alan Tien, a Stanford-educated engineer working on\r\nPayPal’s China efforts since 2004, the AFT/PayPal infighting and the\r\ndisastrous migration of servers to the United States were the\r\nbeginning of the end for eBay in China. In a series of internal memos\r\nto the head office, he tried to raise attention to the seriousness of the\r\nthreat from Alibaba and Alipay. In January 2005 he wrote, “Current\r\nsituation isn’t good. Momentum has shifted away from us. Must\r\nexecute on get well plan to stay in the fight,” adding, “We cannot\r\nafford to deceive ourselves anymore.”\r\neBay just wouldn’t take Alibaba seriously, questioning the\r\nreliability of mounting data that showed Taobao was selling more\r\ngoods than eBay in China. Taobao now had more listings, but eBay\r\nconvinced itself that because those listings were free they must be\r\ninferior. Jack vigorously rejected that thesis: “The survival and growth\r\nof Taobao are not because of free service. 1Pai [the joint venture of\r\nYahoo and Sina] is also free but it is nowhere close to Taobao.\r\nTaobao is more eBay than eBay China [because] Taobao pays more\r\nattention to user experiences.”\r\nSensing it was game over, Alan Tien concluded, “Taobao’s\r\nproduct development cycle is much faster. Jack Ma’s right. We cannot\r\nfight on his terms.”\r\nWhitman had reached the same conclusion and secretly began\r\nto look for a way out of the China morass. The most obvious route\r\nwas to make an offer to buy Alibaba, and so she sent three senior\r\nexecutives28 from San Jose to Hangzhou, where they met Jack and\r\nJoe. The meeting got off to a bad start when eBay senior vice\r\npresident Bill Cobb talked down Taobao’s achievements and CFO\r\nRajiv Dutta offered a lowball number of $150 million to buy the\r\ncompany. After Jack told the eBay delegation that he was just getting\r\nstarted with Taobao, Joe countered with a sales price of $900 million,\r\nat which point the two sides parted company.\r\nHaving failed to buy its rival, Meg Whitman announced29 an\r\ninfusion of an additional $100 million into its China operations. This\r\nwas prompted out of fear of Taobao, but Whitman spun it to investors\r\nas a positive: “The China Internet market is developing more rapidly\r\nthan anticipated. . . . We see even greater opportunities in China\r\ntoday than we did six months ago.” The $100 million was to be spent\r\nupgrading the credit system, hiring personnel, and splashing out a\r\nnew advertising campaign that soon blanketed billboards in China’s\r\nmajor cities.\r\nThis was music to Jack’s ears. He joked to Forbes magazine that\r\neBay had “deep pockets, but we will cut a hole in their pocket.”\r\nTalking to Chinese media, he ridiculed the new investment: “When I\r\nheard that eBay would spend one hundred million dollars to break\r\ninto this market, I didn’t think they had any technical skills. If you use\r\nmoney to solve problems, why on earth would the world need\r\nbusinessmen anymore. Businessmen understand how to use the\r\nsmallest resources to expand.” Even with SoftBank’s backing, Jack\r\ndidn’t have the resources that eBay could bring to China if it wanted.\r\nDismissing eBay’s approach, he added, “Some say that the power of\r\ncapital is enormous. Capital does have its power. But the real power\r\nis the power of people controlling the capital. People’s power is\r\nenormous. Businessmen’s power is inexhaustible.”\r\nHaving earlier ignored them, eBay was now paying a lot of\r\nattention to Alibaba. Jack later commented that he saw this as a\r\ndecisive moment: “The moment she [Meg Whitman] wanted to use\r\nmoney as her strategy we knew she would lose. First they didn’t\r\nconsider us as a rival. Then they treated us too seriously as a rival.\r\nNeither of them was the right [strategy]. When we say, ‘If you have no\r\nenemy in your heart, you will be invincible in the world,’ we mean you\r\nhave different strategies and tactics. In terms of strategies, you must\r\npay attention—whenever there is a rival emerging you have to study\r\nwhether it could become your rival, and if so what to do. Whatever is\r\nstronger than you, you have to learn not to hate it. . . . When you treat\r\nit too seriously as a rival, and intend to kill it, your techniques are\r\ncompletely exposed. . . . Hatred only makes you a shortsighted\r\nperson.”\r\nIn May 2005, Meg Whitman and a number of other key Silicon\r\nValley executives, including Jerry Yang, traveled to Beijing to attend\r\nthe Fortune Global Forum. There Whitman met up with Jack and Joe.\r\nBut further talks, which included a proposal for eBay to invest in\r\nTaobao, came to nothing.\r\nAt PayPal China, the mood was darkening, with Alan Tien writing\r\nto colleagues: “I think it’s absolutely frightening that eBay doesn’t take\r\nthese threats more seriously. . . . Taobao/Alipay has grabbed the\r\nmantle as the auctions/payments leader in China. We are caught on\r\nour heels every time. Yet instead of developing a leapfrog, or even a\r\nflanking, strategy we try to match feature-for-feature, six to nine\r\nmonths later.”\r\nWhile eBay was trying to put on a good face, Whitman was\r\ngrowing increasingly frustrated at the AFT/PayPal infighting, warning\r\nthat PayPal China “is coming to a town near you, whether you like it\r\nor not. Although this may be suboptimal for marketplace, it’s good for\r\neBay Inc. to have two horses in this race.”\r\nInstead of picking AFT or PayPal, eBay had decided to go with\r\nboth—meaning customers in China would have to navigate not one\r\nbut two websites when buying online.\r\nNot surprisingly, running two payment systems in parallel in\r\nChina proved to be a disaster.\r\nCustomer complaints flooded in, such as, “My experience on\r\neBay was painful. Can’t fill order information. I’m a 100 percent good\r\nfeedback user, I was never delinquent, and never broke the rules.\r\nThe payment systems used to be pretty good.” Another customer\r\nvented, “I can’t stand it anymore. Does EachNet call this customer\r\nservice? They can only scare away more users. Did my two\r\npayments totaling 5,000 [yuan] disappear? My confidence in EachNet\r\nis once again severely blown.”\r\nOne customer even complained that his PayPal check was\r\nimpounded by the Bank of China in Nanjing under a law to “prevent\r\noverseas criminals from money laundering through this method.” By\r\nthe middle of 2005, Taobao had facilitated online payments for 80\r\npercent of the products on its sites, but eBay barely 20 percent.\r\nIn a last-ditch attempt to turn things around, Whitman and a\r\nnumber of key executives relocated temporarily from San Jose to\r\nShanghai for a couple of months. With the concentration of senior\r\nexecutives, Shanghai was quickly dubbed “Shang Jose” within eBay.\r\nBut its China business was looking increasingly like a lost cause.\r\neBay shifted its focus to new horizons, including the landmark\r\n$2.6 billion acquisition in September 2005 of Skype.30 In China,\r\nthings went from bad to worse when Taobao reaffirmed its\r\ncommitment to a no-fee model. Extending its pledge of free services\r\nfor a further three years, Taobao vowed to create one million jobs in\r\nChina. eBay’s PR executive, Henry Gomez, fired off a terse press\r\nrelease titled a “Statement from eBay Regarding Taobao’s Pricing\r\nChallenge,” which consisted of the following three sentences:\r\n“Free” is not a business model. It speaks volumes about the\r\nstrength of eBay’s business in China that Taobao today\r\nannounced that it is unable to charge for its products for the next\r\nthree years.\r\nWe’re very proud that eBay is creating a sustainable\r\nbusiness in China, while providing Chinese consumers and\r\nentrepreneurs with the safest, most professional, and most\r\nexciting global trading environment available today.\r\nWhitman and her COO, Maynard Webb, already knew that the\r\nglobal product wasn’t working in China, so they initiated a new project\r\nto launch the best e-commerce site in China from scratch. They\r\ncalled the initiative de nuevo (which means “from scratch” or “anew”\r\nin Spanish). After all the talk about being more sensitive to local\r\nculture in China, adopting a Spanish name for the project hardly\r\ninspired confidence.\r\nBy the end of 2005, eBay’s market share had slipped to barely\r\none-third of the market and Taobao was closing in on 60 percent. Just\r\ntwo months after eBay publicly defended its fee-based business\r\nmodel, eBay stopped charging fees altogether. Having talked up\r\nChina so much to investors, eBay’s struggles there started to weigh\r\non its share price, which dropped dramatically from a high of over $46\r\nin early 2006 to only $24 by August.\r\nJack didn’t pull any punches: “In China, they’re gone. . . . They\r\nhave made so many mistakes in China—we’re lucky.”\r\nHaving failed to team up with Taobao, Whitman launched\r\ndiscussions to sell eBay’s China business to the Li Ka-shing–backed\r\nventure Tom Online, finally abandoning its troubled business by\r\nleaving it in a minority-owned joint venture, along with $40 to 50\r\nmillion in cash. It left a note, in the form of a press release, that, true\r\nto form, attempted to spin an obvious negative as a positive. The joint\r\nventure, it read, left eBay “even better positioned to participate in this\r\ngrowing market. This agreement is a sign of our continued\r\ncommitment to delivering the best online buying and selling\r\nexperiences in China.” The venture quickly faded into obscurity.31\r\neBay had lost China. But in Jack, China had gained a folk hero.\r\nWhen asked today about the experience, Whitman can only tip her\r\nhat to Jack’s achievements.\r\n“If you look at Japan and China, two important markets, it’s\r\nwhere we didn’t strategically, actually do the right thing. But it was not\r\nobvious at the time, honestly. So more power to Jack Ma, what a\r\npowerful franchise he has built—and it is really in some ways the\r\ncombination . . . of eBay, PayPal, and Amazon. He’s done a\r\nremarkable, remarkable job.”\r\neBay had lost a few hundred million dollars on its China folly. But\r\nthis would soon look like small change to Alibaba, thanks to a onebillion-\r\ndollar deal that Jack pulled off thanks to another Silicon Valley\r\ngiant: Yahoo.\r\nChapter Ten\r\nYahoo’s Billion-Dollar Bet\r\nNobody knows the future. You can only create the future.\r\n—Jack Ma\r\nAlibaba put paid to eBay’s ambitions in China. But eBay was not the\r\nfirst Silicon Valley company to run into problems there, nor would it be\r\nthe last. Despite being one of the most popular sites in China when\r\npeople first logged on to the Internet, Yahoo would quickly fall behind\r\n—until a billion-dollar deal with Alibaba changed everything.\r\nJerry Yang\r\nYahoo’s early success in the United States and Jerry Yang’s ethnicity\r\nset up high expectations for the company in China. Known in\r\nmainland China as Yang Zhiyuan (Yang Chih-yuan in his native\r\nTaiwan), Jerry and the company he cofounded1 served as an\r\ninspiration for the founders of Sohu, Sina, and NetEase. His appeal\r\nwent far beyond the tech community. People in China were\r\nfascinated with how a young software engineer born in Taiwan came\r\nto found such an iconic American company and become so wealthy\r\nat such a young age.\r\nBorn in Taiwan in 1968, Yang took the name Jerry after he\r\nmoved to the United States in 1978 with his mother, Lily, and younger\r\nbrother, Ken. His father, born in mainland China, had died from a\r\npulmonary disease when Jerry was just two years old. In Taiwan his\r\nmother had been a teacher, of English and drama, and in California\r\nshe took a job teaching English to other immigrants. The family\r\nsettled in a modest one-story home off Hostetter Road in a suburb of\r\nSan Jose. Jerry’s longtime neighbor Bill Otto remembers him as a\r\n“very congenial” young boy, playing with his husky dog Bodie in the\r\nfront yard and lugging a large backpack off to Sierramont Middle\r\nSchool.\r\nJerry came to the United States with just one word of English\r\n—“shoe”: “We got made fun of a lot at first. I didn’t even know who\r\nthe faces were on the paper money.”\r\nStruggling at first with English, he spent his first two years in the\r\nUnited States in remedial classes. But Jerry excelled in math and\r\nscience. At Piedmont Hills High School he played on the Pirates\r\ntennis team and was elected student council president, finishing his\r\nsenior year as valedictorian and winning a full scholarship to\r\nStanford. A member of the class of 1990, Jerry completed both his\r\nbachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering, and\r\nbetween rounds of golf continued his studies in pursuit of a Ph.D. For\r\none of his classes, Jerry’s teaching assistant at Stanford was David\r\nFilo, two years his elder. David, known for his shyness and reserve,\r\nhad come to Stanford after an undergraduate degree in computer\r\nengineering at Tulane University in New Orleans. Born in Wisconsin,\r\nhis family moved to Louisiana when he was six and he grew up on a\r\ncommune in Moss Bluff. Jerry and David had worked in the same\r\ndesign automation software research group, and while teaching at the\r\nStanford campus in Kyoto, Japan, had become close friends, sharing\r\nan interest in watching sumo wrestling.\r\nReturning to Stanford, they took adjacent cubicles in a Stanford\r\ntrailer, where they launched what would become Yahoo on two\r\nservers: “Akebono” and “Konishiki,” both names of Hawaii-born sumo\r\nwrestlers who had excelled in Japan.\r\nLike the messy Lakeside apartment in Hangzhou where Jack\r\nlaunched Alibaba five years later, the trailer where Jerry and David\r\nlaunched Yahoo was not a pretty site. The company’s first investor,\r\nMichael Moritz of Sequoia Capital, recalled, “With the shades drawn\r\ntight, the Sun servers generating a ferocious amount of heat, the\r\nanswering machine going on and off every couple of minutes, golf\r\nclubs stashed against the walls, pizza cartons on the floor, and\r\nunwashed clothes strewn around . . . it was every mother’s idea of\r\nthe bedroom she wished her sons never had.”\r\nYahoo began as a list of other sites that Jerry and David had\r\nbookmarked using Marc Andreessen’s recently launched Mosaic\r\nbrowser. Known initially as Jerry’s Guide to the World Wide Web,\r\nthen Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web, the list\r\nconsisted at first of a hundred sites categorized manually into\r\nrelevant headings. At first, traffic on the site was a thousand or so\r\nvisitors each week. But by early 1995, traffic had grown to millions of\r\nhits a day. Stanford told them to move the site to their own servers.\r\nJerry and David needed to raise funds to pay for them. Registered as\r\nYahoo.com in January 1995, the company was incorporated in March\r\n1995, and the following month, Sequoia invested $2 million, taking a\r\n25 percent share of the company. The two engineers never finished\r\ntheir Ph.D.s. Jerry recalled, “When I first told my mom what we were\r\ndoing, the best way I could talk about it was like a librarian. And she\r\nsaid you know you went through nine years of school to become a\r\nlibrarian. She was kind of shocked to say the least.”\r\nIn the fall of 1995, Jerry, David, and Yahoo CEO Tim Koogle\r\ninitiated discussions with new investors, including Eric Hippeau, the\r\nCEO of Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, a large publisher of PC and\r\ntechnology magazines. In November, SoftBank acquired Ziff-Davis,\r\nand Hippeau introduced Masayoshi Son to Jerry and David. Son and\r\na colleague flew to meet Yahoo’s founders, in their small office in\r\nMountain View, California, just south of Palo Alto. Meeting over a\r\nlunch of takeout pizza and sodas, Son and the two founders hit it off.\r\nSon agreed to invest $2 million for a 5 percent stake in Yahoo. In\r\nMarch, Son doubled down. In a gutsy move, Son agreed to pay more\r\nthan $100 million to top up his stake, ending up with over 41 percent\r\nof Yahoo, more than Jerry and David, who together held just under 35\r\npercent.\r\nJerry recalled, “Most of us thought he was crazy. . . . Putting\r\n$100 million into a start-up in March 1996 was very aggressive, but I\r\ndon’t think it was luck.”\r\nSoftBank saw the potential for Yahoo in Japan, and the two\r\ncompanies launched their joint venture. Jerry flew to Japan in\r\nJanuary 1996 to oversee preparations. The site, run by Son’s deputy,\r\nMasahiro Inoue, launched three months later and was an instant\r\nsuccess, racking up five million page views per day in January 1997,\r\nand hitting 100 million by July 2000.\r\nOn April 12, 1996, Yahoo went public on the Nasdaq, raising $33\r\nmillion. After a healthy first-day 154 percent gain, investors valued the\r\ncompany at almost $850 million. Yahoo had just $1.4 million in\r\nrevenues2 and losses of over $600,000. Only a year after\r\nincorporating the company, Jerry Yang and David Filo were each\r\nworth more than $165 million on paper. Within three years they were\r\nbillionaires. Their success propelled SoftBank to list in January 1998\r\non the primary board of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, making Son a\r\nbillionaire, too.\r\nYahoo’s popularity spread quickly around the world. The\r\ncompany rolled out localized sites where the business case was\r\nstrongest. China was not a high priority, as Jerry indicated on a visit\r\nto Hong Kong in 1997: “China is probably the last market we want to\r\naddress right now. It may be the most important one, but the last\r\nsequentially. There’s not enough people using the Internet for us to\r\nbe spending money over there.”\r\nInstead, Yahoo started to reach out to other parts of Asia,\r\nlaunching a regional site in Singapore in 1997 targeting Internet users\r\nin Southeast Asia. The following year it launched regional sites\r\ntargeting overseas Chinese users and then users in China itself.3\r\nConsisting of links to ten thousand sites, the Chinese Yahoo was the\r\nthirteenth of its “mirror” sites around the world, hosted on servers in\r\nthe United States and run from its headquarters in Santa Clara,\r\nCalifornia. Visitors could download free Chinese software to help with\r\ndifferent character sets. The site was instantly popular on the\r\nmainland. Several hundred thousand visitors a day came to the site,\r\nimpressive given that China then had less than a million Internet\r\nusers.\r\nAs the Internet gained in popularity in China, Yahoo started to\r\nlook at getting more deeply involved in the country. Jerry, who spoke\r\nfluent Mandarin, had yet to visit mainland China. In a fateful meeting,\r\nin 1997, Jack was his tour guide, assigned to the task while working\r\nfor the government trade ministry in Beijing. In addition to the\r\nbusiness meetings with MOFTEC and others, the trip was an\r\nopportunity for Jerry to see the sights. Jack’s skills as a selfappointed\r\ntour guide on the shores of West Lake in Hangzhou came\r\nin handy when he and Cathy took Jerry, his younger brother Ken, and\r\nYahoo vice president Heather Killen on a trip outside Beijing to see\r\nthe Great Wall.\r\nThe image of Jerry sitting on the Great Wall is an appropriate\r\nmetaphor for Yahoo’s China dilemma. The market was growing\r\nrapidly, now home to millions and soon tens of millions of Internet\r\nusers. Yahoo had already managed to become a dominant player in\r\nJapan, so why not in China, too? But China presented a quandary:\r\nhow to deal with a government intent on control at all costs.\r\nIn 1996, speaking in Singapore, Jerry had shared his views:\r\n“Why the Internet has grown so fast is because it is not regulated.”\r\nThere were limits to how much Jerry’s Chinese ethnicity would\r\ntranslate into an inside track for Yahoo in China: “The First\r\nAmendment safeguards freedom of speech. I’m more American in\r\nterms of my upbringing now.”\r\nYahoo from the outset was about content, and that would be\r\ntricky in China, where all forms of media were tightly controlled. When\r\nYahoo opened its office in Hong Kong, Jerry was asked about the\r\nissue of censorship. He replied that Yahoo would “stay within the\r\nboundaries of the law and try to stay as free as possible.” He\r\ndisclosed that Yahoo was in touch with the authorities in China but “to\r\nbe honest, the policy is not very clear as to what is politically\r\nsensitive,” adding that they had been informed that “as long as we’re\r\njust listing content and not hosting it then we can just go right ahead.”\r\nAlthough Yahoo was initially just a directory of links to websites\r\nrun by third parties, even the choice of which links to present to the\r\npublic was a sensitive matter. Furthermore, Yahoo was no longer just\r\nabout links. Following an early partnership with Reuters the company\r\nadded news content to its site, then chat rooms and, following an\r\nacquisition, Yahoo Mail.\r\nThe expanding scope of Yahoo’s business invited growing\r\nscrutiny from regulators on the mainland, who also harbored\r\nreservations about the company’s links to Taiwan. On a visit to the\r\nisland in 1997, Jerry had been treated as a conquering hero, mobbed\r\nby the media and received by Vice President Lien Chan. His trip\r\ncame just after Taiwan’s relations with Beijing had hit a new low. How\r\ncould Yahoo comfortably serve users both in Taiwan and the\r\nmainland? Jerry Yang admitted it was a challenge: “We may or may\r\nnot be able to get around it, because they [the Chinese government]\r\ncan shut us off. . . . The point there is to take a very neutral stand. I\r\ndon’t know if we can get away with it. We are already running into\r\nproblems.”\r\nCould Yahoo go it alone in China? Or would it be better to pick a\r\nlocal partner, perhaps buying out one of the portal pioneers, such as\r\nCharles Zhang’s Sohu, the original name of which, Sohoo, left no\r\ndoubt as to its plans to become the “Yahoo of China”?\r\nBuild or buy? Either course had its complications. There were\r\nsimply no precedents for Yahoo to look to. AOL opted in the summer\r\nof 1999 to invest in Hong Kong–based China.com. Even after it\r\nreturned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, Hong Kong was exempted4\r\nfrom the draconian media restrictions that made investing in China so\r\nfraught with risk for foreign companies. But China.com was a bit\r\nplayer in China, and even AOL’s Steve Case admitted that Hong\r\nKong was just “a logical staging area for China. We want to launch\r\nHong Kong, and then we’ll see what happens.” (AOL’s subsequent\r\npartnership in mainland China, with the computer manufacturer\r\nLegend Holdings, never gained traction.)\r\nIn September 1999, Jerry announced in Beijing that Yahoo was\r\ngoing into the mainland in a joint venture with Founder, a Chinese\r\nmanufacturer of personal computers and software. The choice of\r\npartner was uninspiring but safe: The company was a spin-off from\r\nPeking University and retained strong ties to the Chinese\r\ngovernment. Yahoo was finally in China itself, adding the coveted\r\n“.cn” suffix to become www.yahoo.com.cn. The site started as a\r\ndirectory of links to twenty thousand Chinese websites, plus\r\nadditional content translated from its U.S. website, and Yahoo Mail\r\nand instant messenger. COO Jeffrey Mallett acknowledged that\r\nChina wouldn’t be easy: “We are walking into this with our eyes wide\r\nopen. The site significantly expands the existing features of a\r\nChinese Yahoo website already online, and it is being hosted in\r\nChina by government-owned Beijing Telecom.”\r\nYahoo’s launch in China came just as the country’s own portal\r\npioneers had been dealt a blow in their efforts to launch an IPO. The\r\nannouncement from Wu Jichuan, the powerful minister of information\r\nindustry, appeared to ban all foreign investment in the Internet:\r\n“Whether or not it is an ICP [Internet content provider] or ISP [Internet\r\nservice provider], it is about value-added services. In China, the\r\nservice area is not open.”\r\nYet, in an illustration of the gray area in which the Internet was\r\noperating, Minister Wu’s own deputy5 was onstage with Jerry Yang at\r\nthe launch of Yahoo China, her presence as good a sign as any that\r\nWu had given his tacit blessing to the venture. But an MII official\r\ndescribed Yahoo’s business as still being offshore, with Founder\r\nmerely acting as a trustee: “No company was set up inside China’s\r\nborder.” This admission revealed that, as with many deals in China,\r\nthe negotiations only began once an agreement had been signed.\r\nAfter the launch ceremony in Beijing, Jerry flew down to\r\nShanghai to attend the Fortune Global Forum. He was one of sixty\r\nFortune 500 CEOs—including AOL’s Steve Case, GE’s Jack Welch,\r\nand Viacom’s Sumner Redstone—along with other dignitaries,\r\nincluding Henry Kissinger, who gathered at the new, $100 million\r\ninternational convention center built in the city’s Pudong district, on\r\nthe right bank of the Huangpu River, directly opposite the city’s iconic\r\nBund. China’s president Jiang Zemin inaugurated the Global Forum:\r\n“Set your eyes on China. China welcomes you. China’s\r\nmodernization needs your participation, and China’s economic\r\ndevelopment will offer you tremendous opportunities.”\r\nThe American host for the event was Gerald M. “Jerry” Levin,\r\nCEO of Time Warner, the publisher of Fortune magazine. Burnishing\r\nhis credentials as an insider in China, Levin introduced the president\r\nof China onstage as “my good friend Jiang Zemin.” The forum was a\r\nfrenzy of China and Internet-infused deal making that soon swept up\r\nJerry Levin himself. Soon afterward he inked Time Warner’s $165\r\nbillion merger with AOL, a deal that became notorious as “the worst\r\nmerger in history.”\r\nUnlike that deal, Yahoo’s partnership with Founder in China\r\nended up having little consequence. Founder was not the gatekeeper\r\nto China that Jerry Yang had hoped. The company’s links to the\r\nChinese government, which Yahoo had looked to as a shield from\r\nregulatory uncertainty, also prevented an entrepreneurial culture from\r\never taking root. Yahoo China’s content was boring, and Chinese\r\nInternet users noticed, being drawn instead to the more compelling\r\nofferings of Sina, NetEase, and Sohu. Yahoo was losing the battle to\r\nstay relevant in China just as the country’s Internet population was\r\ntaking off.\r\nVictor Koo, then COO of Sohu,6 recalled that “Yahoo China could\r\nnot match us in scale, localization, or investment. That was why it lost\r\nthe China market.” Their IPOs in 2000, facilitated by the VIE\r\ninvestment structure, allowed the three portals to survive the dot-com\r\ncrash. Within a few years they had become profitable companies for\r\nthe first time.\r\nBut, unbeknownst to them, the era of the China Internet portals\r\nwas coming to an end, replaced by a new era of the “Three\r\nKingdoms” of the “BAT”: Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.\r\nYahoo’s struggles, and backing, were to provide Alibaba its entry\r\nticket to this exclusive club. Here’s how.\r\nTencent\r\nTencent harnessed two trends that would transform the Chinese\r\nInternet sector: content delivered to cell phones, and online games\r\nplayed on PCs. Founded a few months before Alibaba, Tencent\r\n(tengxun in Chinese) was launched in late 1998 by two twenty-sevenyear-\r\nold computer scientists who had met at Shenzhen University.\r\nPony Ma (Ma Huateng) later became chairman and CEO of the\r\ncompany and is today one of China’s richest men. Although no\r\nrelation to Jack, Pony’s last name, Ma, is the same as Jack’s, his\r\nEnglish name chosen as a joke since “Ma” means horse in Chinese.\r\nLike Jack, Pony came from a modest background, and although\r\nhe is much shyer than Jack he could also claim to be “one hundred\r\npercent Made in China.” He was born in the coastal city of Shantou,\r\nGuangdong Province. His father worked as a port manager in\r\nShenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong.\r\nAfter graduation, Pony took a job developing software for mobile\r\npagers, a key entry point to the exploding market for cellular\r\ncommunications that would make his fortune. Time magazine\r\nanointed him as “China’s Mobile Mogul.” Pony named his company\r\nTencent because the cost of sending a mobile text message at the\r\ntime was ten Chinese cents (about 1.2 U.S. cents). Tencent’s\r\nbreakthrough product was its OICQ instant messaging client, installed\r\non desktop computers, which was essentially a clone of the ICQ (“I\r\nseek you”) product developed by Israeli company Mirabilis.7 Facing\r\nthe threat of a lawsuit, Tencent rebranded its service as “QQ,” the\r\nletters chosen to approximate “cute” in Chinese. With a cuddly\r\npenguin in a red scarf for a mascot, the service became a big hit with\r\nyoung Chinese Internet users, initially on PCs, then on cell phones.\r\nWhen China’s telecom operators began offering revenue-sharing\r\npartnerships with Internet players, Tencent’s mobile business really\r\ntook off. The partnerships, modeled on NTT DoCoMo’s iMode in\r\nJapan, offered up to 85 percent of the new revenues generated. As\r\nmentioned earlier, when SARS hit the country many Chinese turned\r\nto mobile text messaging to gather or spread information about the\r\noutbreak.\r\nTencent has been the leading player in China’s mobile social\r\nnetworking market ever since. But mobile messaging alone doesn’t\r\nexplain its meteoric rise. The company’s biggest business today is\r\nonline games.8 Tencent’s success in offering MMORPG (massively\r\nmultiplayer online role playing games) titles such as The Legend of\r\nMir 2 and Lineage, pioneered in South Korea, unlocked the largest\r\nrevenue streams in China’s Internet sector.9 Tencent’s success in\r\nQQ, games, and later with WeChat would propel its market\r\ncapitalization in 2015 to exceed $200 billion, surpassing at times\r\nAlibaba, and generating a gold mine of tens of billions of dollars for\r\nthe South African media company Naspers. In 2001, Naspers made\r\none of the best investments in China, in any sector, ever—acquiring a\r\n46.5 percent stake, three times that of founder Pony Ma, in the\r\ncompany for a mere $32 million from investors, including Richard Li,\r\nthe son of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing.\r\nBaidu\r\nBaidu was founded in Beijing in 2000 by Robin Li (Li Yanhong) and\r\nhis friend Dr. Eric Xu (Xu Yong). Born in November 1968, Robin was\r\none of five children of factory workers in Shanxi, a gritty province in\r\ncentral China. His smarts won him entry to Peking University to study\r\ninformation science. After June 4, 1989, he was keen to head\r\noverseas: “China was a depressing place. . . . I thought there was no\r\nhope.”\r\nRejected from the top three U.S. schools he had applied to,\r\nRobin won a full scholarship in 1991 for a master’s degree in\r\ncomputer science at the State University of New York (SUNY) at\r\nBuffalo. There he joined a computer lab focused on designing\r\nautomation technologies, funded by a grant from the U.S. Postal\r\nService. His professor, Sargur N. Srihari, recalled that “he started\r\ndoing information retrieval here at Buffalo, and we were well ahead of\r\nthe game in terms of the importance of search engines.”\r\nAfter SUNY, Robin worked for a subsidiary of Dow Jones in New\r\nYork. Visitors today to Baidu’s one-million-square-foot campus in\r\nBeijing are shown a copy of Robin’s patent filing from February 5,\r\n1997—when he still worked for Dow Jones—for a search mechanism\r\nhe called “hypertext document retrieval” that determined the\r\npopularity of a website based on the number of other websites that\r\nhad linked to it. Robin then moved to California to work for the search\r\ncompany Infoseek, before raising $1.2 million in start-up funding and\r\nreturning to China in January 2000 to found Baidu. The company first\r\noperated out of a hotel room near his alma mater, Peking University,\r\nits business starting as a third-party supplier of Chinese language\r\nsearch engines to other websites.10 Although it quickly gained the\r\nbulk of the market, Baidu wasn’t profitable.\r\nRobin Li, CEO, recalled, “I wanted to continue to improve the\r\nsearch experience, but the portals didn’t want to pay for it. . . . That’s\r\nwhen I knew we needed our own branded service.” Baidu’s standalone\r\nsearch website was launched in October 2001.\r\nRobin Li has remained closely involved in Baidu’s technology\r\ndevelopment. To ensure that its search engine was cutting-edge, in\r\nlate 2001, Li temporarily set aside his role as CEO to drive a new\r\ndevelopment project called “Project Blitzen,” recalled by the\r\ncompany’s engineering team as a “Great Leap Forward” effort. Li\r\nwould often sleep in the office, and meetings doubled in frequency\r\nuntil the project was completed.\r\nLooking back, Li said, “Once you find out what you should do,\r\nthen you need to stay focused. That’s what we did during the difficult\r\ntimes back in year 2000, 2001, 2002. Many people think search was\r\na done deal. It’s boring. Everyone has figured that out in terms of\r\ntechnology and product, but we thought we could do a better job. We\r\nresisted all kinds of temptations from being a portal, being an SMS\r\nplayer, online games, developing all kinds of things that could make\r\nmoney in the short term. We really, really focused on Chinese search.\r\nThat’s how we got here.”\r\nIn 2002, Baidu’s Chinese index of searchable sites was 50\r\npercent greater than its nearest rival’s. By 2003 it had become the\r\nnumber one search engine in China. Prior to Baidu’s August 2005\r\nIPO on Nasdaq, even Google invested $5 million in it. Baidu’s shares\r\nrose more than 350 percent on the first day of trading. As it became\r\napparent that Baidu was now its chief rival in China, Google sold its\r\nstake the following summer for $60 million.\r\nBaidu would emerge as China’s largest search engine.11\r\nAlthough worth around $70 billion, it remains a much smaller\r\ncompany than Alibaba and Tencent, two companies that,\r\ninterestingly, enjoy a better relationship with each other than they do\r\nwith Baidu.\r\nYahoo and “AK47”\r\nBut back in 2003, there was little sign of the emergence of the “BAT.”\r\nYahoo thought it still had a shot at cracking the China market. In\r\nsearch, Yahoo partnered with Baidu. To take on eBay, Yahoo\r\nlaunched an online auction venture with Sina. But, like the Founder\r\npartnership, neither deal made a difference.\r\nBecoming increasingly desperate for a fix for its China business,\r\nin November 2003, Yahoo announced a deal it hoped would\r\ntransform its fortunes, buying a company called 3721 Network\r\nSoftware.\r\nFounded five years earlier by a feisty entrepreneur called Zhou\r\nHongyi, 3721 had spotted a niche in the market. Domain names in\r\nthe Internet were available only in alphanumeric characters (one\r\nreason it had chosen numbers rather than a name in the Roman\r\nalphabet, for its own website, since “3721” was a saying for\r\nsomething easy, as “easy as 3 times 7 equals 21”).\r\nThe company 3721 allowed the millions of new users coming\r\nonline in China to search using Chinese characters thanks to a\r\nspecial toolbar that would then link the Chinese characters input to\r\nthe corresponding website. The software was downloaded, although\r\nnot always with the user’s knowledge, and was hard to remove.\r\nCompetitors criticized 3721’s technology, arguing it supplanted\r\nexisting browsers. In 2002, Baidu took 3721 to court, one of many\r\nInternet companies to tussle with Zhou Hongyi; 3721 raised several\r\nrounds of venture capital and by 2001 had broken even. By\r\nassembling a large sales force to market the most valuable Chinese\r\nnames in the tool bar, 3721 started to make a lot of money,\r\ngenerating $17 million in revenues in 2002.\r\nBorn in 1970 in southern China’s Hubei Province, Zhou Hongyi\r\ngrew up in the agricultural province of Henan before attending Xi’an\r\nJiaotong University. He tried his hand as an entrepreneur twice, but\r\nboth ventures failed before Zhou signed on as an employee of\r\nFounder, China’s largest university-run enterprise. Three years later,\r\nhe launched 3721 in partnership with his wife, Helen Hu (Hu Huan),\r\nand four others.\r\nZhou felt his earlier failures cost him his rightful place as a true\r\npioneer of the Internet industry, and he was constantly spoiling for a\r\nfight with his rivals. He relished the publicity of the lawsuits or public\r\nspats he engaged in with Jack, Robin Li, Pony Ma, William Ding, and\r\nLei Jun (Kingsoft and Xiaomi), among others.\r\nJerry Yang was known for his affable and approachable manner,\r\nbut Zhou was the polar opposite: a self-styled bad boy of the Internet\r\nin China. He had a passion for guns. After 3721 was acquired by\r\nYahoo, Zhou’s new colleagues in Sunnyvale, California, were aghast\r\nwhen they saw his photo in the Yahoo internal directory, in which he\r\ntoted an AK-47. The team immediately adopted it as his nickname.\r\nZhou even liked to adorn the walls of his office with bullet-hole ridden\r\nsheets from target practice. His main investor, Wang Gongquan from\r\nIDG, described Zhou as a “frenzied idealist,” an “aggressive and wild\r\nchild.”\r\nWhatever their differences in personality, Jerry Yang saw in Zhou\r\nHongyi’s firm the opportunity to boost Yahoo China’s revenues. In\r\n2003, Yahoo China made only a few million dollars in revenue, but\r\n3721 raked in an estimated $25 million from its clients. It was the\r\nfourth-most-visited Chinese website after Sina, Sohu, and NetEase.\r\nIn November 2003, Yahoo acquired 3721 for $120 million (with\r\n$50 million paid up front, and $70 million to follow based on\r\nperformance in the following two years). The deal boosted Yahoo’s\r\nChina team, from 100 to nearly 300. But just as eBay botched its\r\nacquisition of local partner EachNet, Yahoo’s efforts to integrate 3721\r\nrapidly fell apart.\r\nThe culture clash was immediate. Former Yahoo CFO Sue\r\nDecker recalls, “Zhou reportedly felt that the original Yahoos were\r\noverpaid and lazy, whereas the Yahoo team felt bullied and believed\r\nZhou wasn’t focused on the Yahoo operations.” Yahoo had carefully\r\ncourted relations with the Chinese government. But just a couple of\r\nmonths after Yahoo acquired his company 3721, Zhou Hongyi was\r\nsued by none other than the Chinese government, whose Internet\r\ndomain name agency, the China Internet Network Information Center\r\n(CNNIC) accused 3721 of damaging its reputation.12\r\nNext, Zhou dumped Baidu, which he was in the process of suing,\r\nas Yahoo’s search partner in China, and launched a new search\r\noffering instead.13 But Zhou hadn’t consulted first with Yahoo\r\nexecutives in Sunnyvale. Zhou recalled, “I believed that with an\r\nannual investment of only several millions of dollars, it would be\r\nentirely possible for us to overtake Baidu.” Zhou became frustrated by\r\nthe managers at Yahoo headquarters: “They were unwilling to invest\r\nin the company’s future. It is like farming. If you only care about\r\nharvesting, but not fertilizing or cultivating, eventually the land will\r\nlose its vitality.”\r\nChina was the least of Yahoo’s worries. In the United States, the\r\ncompany was being eclipsed by Google, whose algorithmic search\r\nengine was outgunning Yahoo’s directory-based design. Yahoo was\r\nslow to recognize the threat posed by Google, a company like Yahoo\r\nfounded by two Stanford Ph.D. candidates. Yahoo had missed an\r\nopportunity in 1997 to buy Google from Larry Page and Sergey Brin,\r\nbut its biggest mistake of all was the June 2000 decision to make\r\nGoogle its search partner. With Google’s logo featured on its home\r\npage, millions of customers discovered a superior search product and\r\ngateway to the broader Internet that made Yahoo increasingly\r\nirrelevant.14\r\nIn July 2005, six months before the end of his two-year earn-out,\r\nZhou announced he was quitting Yahoo China. Within two months he\r\nhad set up his own company, Qihoo 360 Technology. Here he would\r\nadopt the same aggressive tactics15 that he’d used at 3721.\r\nIt wasn’t long before Zhou took to the media to criticize Yahoo,\r\ntelling journalists that selling 3721 to Yahoo was his biggest regret,\r\nthat Yahoo’s corporate culture stifled innovation, and that the firm was\r\npoorly managed: “Yahoo’s leaders have unshakable responsibility for\r\nits decline. Whether it is spiritual leader Jerry Yang or former CEO\r\n[Terry] Semel, they are good people, but [they] are not geniuses.\r\nThey lack true leadership qualities. When facing competition from\r\nGoogle and Microsoft, they didn’t know what to do, and had no sense\r\nof direction.”\r\nYahoo had struck out twice in China: first Founder, then 3721.\r\nAfter years of frustration, Jerry Yang made a bold decision. He\r\nhanded Jack $1 billion, and the keys to Yahoo China’s business, in\r\nexchange for a 40 percent stake in Alibaba.\r\nProject Pebble\r\nAlthough it took some time for them to realize it, the deal was\r\ntransformative for Alibaba and Yahoo. Alibaba gained the ammunition\r\nto finish off eBay in China, and to build Taobao and Alipay into the\r\nbehemoths that they are today. The rising value of its stake16 gave\r\nYahoo leverage in dealing with its increasingly frustrated investors,\r\nconcerned about its deteriorating market position versus Google and\r\nits subsequent controversial decision to rebuff Microsoft’s offer to buy\r\nthe company.\r\nThe deal originated in a May 2005 meeting17 between Jack and\r\nJerry at the Pebble Beach golf course in California. Before a steakand-\r\nseafood dinner with other tech luminaries from the United States\r\nand China, the two founders, who had a common shareholder in\r\nMasayoshi Son, took a stroll18 outside. Jack recalled, “It was\r\nextremely cold that day, and after ten minutes I couldn’t bear it\r\nanymore. I ran back indoors. [But] in those ten minutes we\r\nexchanged some ideas. I told him clearly that I wanted to enter the\r\nsearch business, and my opinion was that search engines would play\r\na very important role in e-commerce in the future.”\r\nFrom this initial discussion, the outlines of a deal—which Yahoo\r\ncalled Project Pebble—started to take shape two weeks later when\r\nJerry19 held further meetings with Jack and Joe on the sidelines of\r\nthe Fortune Global Forum, hosted that year in Beijing.\r\nYahoo had known for some time that 3721 was not going to be\r\nthe silver bullet to solve its China woes. But after a thorough\r\nscreening of which company might be the answer, Alibaba had not\r\nbeen Yahoo’s first choice.\r\nSina was the most logical target. The company had started as an\r\nInternet portal and was positioning itself as the “undisputed online\r\nmedia leader in China.” Guided by CEO Terry Semel,20 Yahoo was\r\nincreasingly trying to become a media and entertainment company.\r\nYahoo and Sina had already signed a memorandum of understanding\r\nfor Yahoo to invest in Sina, subject to Chinese government approval.\r\nSina’s executives and investors were ready to pop the champagne\r\ncorks when Sina CEO Wang Yan went to meet China’s propaganda\r\nchief, Li Changchun.21 Li rejected the deal. Sina would not be allowed\r\nto align itself with a foreign strategic investor.\r\nDavid Chao, a partner at the investment firm DCM, related a\r\nconversation in 2004 with Hurst Lin, then COO of Sina: “When their\r\nstock was about three dollars Hurst called me up and said, ‘I just met\r\nJerry and I think I can finally get rid of my stock. We have a deal.’ He\r\nwas really happy. But, of course, as you know ‘the forces above’ were\r\nuncomfortable.”\r\nYahoo’s second choice of partner was Shanda, the Shanghaibased\r\nonline games specialist.22 But Shanda’s founder and CEO, the\r\nZhejiang-born Timothy Chen (Chen Tianqiao), wasn’t interested.23\r\nBaidu wasn’t an option for Yahoo, either; it was already on its way to\r\nan IPO.\r\nA deal with Alibaba was attractive on a number of levels. It was a\r\nprivate company, and this meant a deal could be struck quickly.\r\nYahoo and Alibaba had a common shareholder. SoftBank owned 42\r\npercent of Yahoo and 27 percent of Alibaba.24\r\nAnother positive was good chemistry. Jerry and Jack had known\r\neach other for seven years, since their first meeting in Beijing, when\r\nJack played tour guide. The two men hadn’t stayed in regular contact,\r\nbut they had established a rapport.\r\nFor Jerry, dealing with Jack was a breath of fresh air after the\r\ncantankerous Zhou Hongyi. Jerry also got on well with Joe Tsai. Both\r\nwere born in Taiwan and educated in the United States. Yahoo CFO\r\nSue Decker recalled that the two companies “immediately felt a\r\nstrong cultural alignment.”\r\nYet the logic of the combination was not immediately obvious.\r\nYahoo, a consumer content company, was to hand over its China\r\nassets to a company that was essentially a B2B business information\r\ncompany with two newer businesses, Taobao and Alipay, tacked on.\r\nTaobao was gaining traction in consumer e-commerce, but Alibaba\r\nhad recently committed not to charge fees for the next three years.\r\nHow do you value free? Sue Decker recalled Yahoo’s concerns: “At\r\nthe time this seemed like a big leap of faith: More than half the value\r\nof the venture—more than two billion dollars—was attributed to\r\nTaobao and Alipay, both of which were losing money.” The decision to\r\nhand over Yahoo’s China business was a gutsy move, as Decker\r\nrecalled, “We realized we needed to be willing to give up all operating\r\ncontrol. Practically speaking, this meant forgoing our previous desire\r\nto own more than fifty percent of the local operations. It also meant\r\nwe would leave all employee issues to our partner and allow our code\r\nto be used by people with no previous connection to the company.\r\nScary.”\r\nA decade later, Jerry Yang reflected25 on the deal, pointing out\r\nthat in 2005, when Yahoo made the investment: “The balance sheet\r\nat Yahoo was around $3 billion, so it wasn’t as though there were\r\nhuge amounts of cash at Yahoo.” Putting a billion dollars into Alibaba,\r\nhe added “probably raised a lot of eyebrows.” Although Yahoo\r\nconducted extensive analysis on the underlying business, Jack’s\r\ncharisma and vision for Alibaba also played an important role, as\r\nJerry recalled, “It was probably in retrospect a big bet, but if you met\r\nJack, and having got to know him and seeing what his vision was,\r\nyou certainly thought it was worth it. And he really had an inside track\r\non being a very dominant commerce platform in China, so that really\r\ngave us a lot of comfort.” Asked about which company got the better\r\nside of the deal, he answered, “If you look at that partnership over ten\r\nyears, clearly Alibaba was a beneficiary of a very strong vote of\r\nconfidence back in 2005, and now Yahoo as a company is a\r\nbeneficiary of that investment.”\r\nFor Alibaba, the deal immediately delivered the cash it needed to\r\nsupport Taobao, still unprofitable, in its fights with eBay. Yahoo and\r\nSoftBank already had a profitable relationship stretching back almost\r\na decade. The Yahoo investment in Alibaba added a new dimension,\r\ncreating a “Golden Triangle” that has linked Jack, Jerry, and\r\nMasayoshi Son for a decade more. With the deal, the New York\r\nTimes crowned Jack as “China’s New Internet King.” Jack couldn’t\r\nresist taking yet another shot at eBay: “Thank you, eBay. . . . You\r\nmade all of this possible.”\r\nWith the sale, Alibaba was also able to reward its employees, by\r\nallowing them to cash out a quarter of their shares, and its early\r\ninvestors, who sold about 40 percent of their stakes in the company\r\nto Yahoo at a valuation of about $4 billion. Although they had made\r\nan impressive return, the investors then saw Alibaba sell a stake in\r\nitself to Yahoo at a valuation some four times higher.26\r\nJack later emphasized that the impact of the transaction went\r\nbeyond the funding and market recognition provided by Yahoo.\r\nAlthough Alibaba had demonstrated its ability to build start-ups—\r\nAlibaba.com, Taobao, and Alipay—the deal brought much-needed\r\nexperience in mergers and acquisitions, something that would\r\nbecome increasingly important in the future.\r\nThe final ownership of Alibaba would be Yahoo, 40 percent;\r\nSoftBank, 30 percent; and existing management, 30 percent. In 1999,\r\nJack had sold a 50 percent stake in Alibaba to Goldman Sachs and\r\nother investors—something he had joked was the worst deal he ever\r\nmade. Did he feel any seller’s remorse about parting with this 40\r\npercent stake? A decade later he again looked back on the deal: “I\r\nasked for one billion dollars, and they gave us one billion dollars. I\r\nthought the war between Taobao and eBay would last for a long time,\r\nso we needed enough cash to fight.” In the end, $1 billion was\r\nenough to scare off eBay.27 “We asked a lot. But we did not know\r\nwhen we got the money eBay would run away. So the money [wasn’t\r\nused].” Jack said he would do the Yahoo deal again but “in a better,\r\nsmarter way,” adding, “Nobody knows the future. You can only create\r\nthe future.”\r\nThe deal left Jack and Joe in charge of Alibaba, although the\r\nagreement also included a little-noticed clause that gave Yahoo the\r\nright, in October 2010, to appoint an additional board member. If that\r\nboard member aligned with SoftBank, then Yahoo could then enjoy a\r\nmajority and the ability, in theory, to take control of Alibaba.\r\nThe key terms decided, Alibaba and Yahoo prepared to position\r\nthe deal to the public. Jerry Yang told BusinessWeek that Alibaba\r\nwas now “the only company in China that has commerce, search,\r\ncommunications, and a very, very strong local management team.\r\nThis is going to be a very valuable franchise going forward.” The\r\nmedia reaction was mixed. Andreas Kluth at The Economist was\r\nunconvinced: “Yahoo can’t keep on being all things to all people. It\r\nseems to me that Yahoo has to decide what it is, which means\r\ndeciding what it’s not. Does Yahoo think that it’s a search and a\r\nmedia and an e-commerce company now? So why not\r\nmanufacturing, retailing, banking, health care? So I’m confused.”\r\nYahoo was keen to reassure the market, and its employees, that\r\nAlibaba was a safe pair of hands to manage its China business.\r\nYahoo China staffers in particular were unhappy about the change in\r\nownership. Former Yahoo China employee Liu Jie, who quit the\r\ncompany for Qihoo soon after, remembered the jarring change in\r\nmanagement style under Alibaba: “At noon the sales-oriented\r\ndepartments at Alibaba would jog and sing. I felt a bit low at that\r\ntime.”\r\nThe reception in Yahoo’s headquarters was more positive.\r\nFormer executive vice president Rich Riley28 recalled, “Markets like\r\nChina had proven challenging for Western companies,” adding that,\r\n“this seemed like a smart way to go.”\r\nBut other than the financial return, did Yahoo achieve its other\r\nobjectives?\r\nWhen the deal was announced, Jerry Yang told the media that\r\nalthough Alibaba was taking over Yahoo in China, this didn’t mean\r\nthe end of the Yahoo brand in the country: “All of the consumer\r\nInternet products will be branded Yahoo—search, mail, and anything\r\nnew they decide to come up with. They definitely feel that the Yahoo\r\nbrand in China has not only global implications but a lot of\r\nresonance.”\r\nYet under Alibaba’s management the Yahoo brand would rapidly\r\nfade and indeed eventually disappear entirely from China. Within a\r\nyear of the deal, local media started to refer to Yahoo China as the\r\nunwanted “orphaned child,” with Alibaba more focused on nurturing\r\nits own baby, Taobao. In May 2007, Alibaba changed the name of the\r\nbusiness from Yahoo China to China Yahoo, an apt reflection of who\r\nwas in charge.\r\nAlibaba did invest heavily in the Yahoo China brand at first,\r\npouring in 30 million yuan (over $4 million) to make TV ads to\r\npromote Yahoo Search. Jack spared no expense for the ads,\r\npartnering with the Huayi Brothers film studios, in which he would\r\nlater invest, and hiring three of China’s most famous directors, Chen\r\nKaige, Feng Xiaogang (who directed Alibaba’s Singles’ Day TV\r\nspecial in 2015), and Zhang Jizhong. Zhang was known for his\r\nflamboyant, big-budget TV adaptations of Jack’s favorite author Jin\r\nYong.\r\nBut in the core area of search, the superior algorithmic search of\r\nGoogle and Baidu was winning out. China Yahoo was in trouble. After\r\nthe deal, Jack became exasperated at how slow Yahoo was in\r\ndelivering on the search and other technology it had committed to\r\nprovide. The pressure was so great that in 2006 Jack made the\r\ndecision to remodel Yahoo’s home page in the uncluttered, clean\r\nstyle popularized by Google, which Baidu had already mimicked. But\r\nJerry Yang was very unhappy with the move and asked Jack to\r\nchange the China Yahoo site back to its original portal look and feel,\r\nwhich he did. Not surprisingly, Yahoo’s users were confused by the\r\nchanges, and the company’s market share slid further. From a 21\r\npercent share of search revenue in 2005, driven largely by the 3721\r\ntool bar, Yahoo’s share fell to only 6 percent in 2009 as Baidu’s\r\nsoared to take almost two-thirds of the market, leaving Google with\r\njust 29 percent.\r\nMessy Exit\r\nBut had Yahoo soldiered on without selling its China business to\r\nAlibaba, the company would still have had to contend with two major\r\nchallenges: 3721 founder Zhou Hongyi, and an ethical and public\r\nrelations catastrophe involving Chinese journalist Shi Tao.\r\nZhou Hongyi, on learning of the Yahoo-Alibaba deal, immediately\r\nannounced his resignation and became a disgruntled former\r\nemployee. He began to brief journalists that he would be starting his\r\nown venture and started to hire people away from Yahoo. In the\r\ncoming years Zhou and his new firm, Qihoo 360, caused a lot of\r\nheadaches29 for Alibaba, China Yahoo’s new owner.\r\nBut even after it sold its China business to Alibaba, Yahoo’s\r\nimage would be tarnished in the United States by the case of\r\nimprisoned Chinese journalist Shi Tao. The source of intense\r\npersonal anguish for Jerry Yang, the affair would illustrate the\r\nunpredictable risks that awaited any foreign company planning to\r\nbuild a business in China’s Internet sector.\r\nShi Tao was an editor and reporter at a newspaper in Changsha,\r\nthe capital of Hunan Province, called Contemporary Trade News\r\n(Dangdai Shang Bao). He was also a customer of Yahoo Mail. On\r\nApril 20, 2004, Shi participated in an internal editorial meeting,\r\nconvened by the newspaper’s deputy general editor, to discuss a\r\nclassified document sent from Beijing with instructions on how to\r\navoid social unrest in the run-up to the fifteenth anniversary of the\r\nJune 4 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Although copies of the\r\ndocument were not handed out, Shi Tao took notes during the\r\nmeeting later that evening using a Yahoo China email account,30 then\r\nemailed them to a Chinese, prodemocracy website based in New\r\nYork. Two days later, Yahoo China was requested by the government\r\nto hand over details of the account owner,31 which they provided that\r\nday.\r\nOn November 23, 2004, Shi was detained by the State Security\r\nBureau in Changsha. On December 15 he was arrested and charged\r\nwith revealing state secrets. After a trial lasting two hours in March\r\n2005, Shi was found guilty and sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.\r\nShi’s case was quickly taken up by activist groups32 who\r\naccused Yahoo of being a “police informant.” The publicity and\r\nappeals, launched by Shi’s journalist friends and his mother, Gao\r\nQinsheng, were unsuccessful in reversing the verdict. After what\r\nAmnesty International alleged was intense harassment from the\r\nChinese government, Shi’s wife divorced him.\r\nIt was a nightmare for Shi and his family. For Yahoo it was a\r\nblack eye. For Alibaba, although it now ran the China business, the\r\ncase had happened on Yahoo’s watch. Jack was asked to comment\r\non the case and said, “As a business, if you cannot change the law,\r\nfollow the law. . . . Respect the local government. We’re not\r\ninterested in politics. We’re just focused on e-commerce.”\r\nOn September 10, 2005, I attended Alibaba’s Alifest in\r\nHangzhou. The partylike atmosphere was heightened that year by the\r\nnewly minted $1 billion deal with Yahoo and the growing sense that\r\nTaobao would prevail over eBay. Jerry Yang was to appear onstage\r\nwith Jack as part of the celebrations. The icing on the cake was\r\nJack’s invited keynote speaker that year: former U.S. president Bill\r\nClinton.\r\nClinton had accepted the invitation to speak in July, but news of\r\nthe Yahoo connection to Shi Tao’s case emerged only days before\r\nthe summit, putting Clinton33 in an awkward position. Clinton did not\r\nrefer to Shi’s case but discussed more generally the economic cost of\r\ncensorship and the need for China to develop greater tolerance for\r\ndissent.\r\nAfter Clinton left the room with his Secret Service and Chinese\r\ngovernment security detail, Jerry Yang took the stage for a Q&A\r\nsession to talk about the deal with Alibaba. Washington Post reporter\r\nPeter S. Goodman asked Jerry Yang directly about Yahoo’s role in\r\nhanding over the information that led to Shi Tao’s incarceration.\r\nYang answered, “To be doing business in China, or anywhere\r\nelse in the world, we have to comply with local law. . . . We don’t\r\nknow what they want that information for, we’re not told what they\r\nlook for. If they give us the proper documentation and court orders,\r\nwe give them things that satisfy both our privacy policy and the local\r\nrules.” He added, “I do not like the outcome of what happens with\r\nthese things. . . . But we have to follow the law.”\r\nThe audience, made up mostly of Chinese Internet executives\r\nand investors, erupted into applause, what seemed like an\r\ninappropriate response given the seriousness of the case, but thanks\r\nto the Great Firewall few in the audience had even heard of Shi Tao.\r\nThings would get much worse for Jerry Yang after that, culminating in\r\na public skewering in Washington, D.C., in 2007 when he was\r\nsummoned to appear before Congress34 to answer questions about\r\nthe case. The committee chairman, California congressman Tom\r\nLantos, opened the session by introducing Shi Tao’s mother. Jerry\r\nYang, wearing a dark suit and tie, bowed solemnly to her three times\r\nas she sat behind him sobbing. Lantos lambasted Yahoo for its\r\n“inexcusably negligent behavior at best and deliberately deceptive\r\nbehavior at worst” and concluded, “While technologically and\r\nfinancially you are giants, morally you are pygmies.”\r\nYahoo later settled out of court a lawsuit filed by Shi’s family,\r\npaying an undisclosed amount. Shi Tao was released in September\r\n2013 after serving eight and a half years in prison, his ten-year\r\nsentence having been earlier reduced by fifteen months.\r\nYahoo’s travails proved that for companies dealing with Internet\r\ncontent, China was a highly risky market, as Google would later\r\nexperience itself before it closed up most of its operations in 2010.\r\nGoogle had launched its search engine on servers hosted in China\r\n(as google.cn) in 2006, keeping servers for Gmail and other products\r\nthat involved personal and confidential information offshore. But in\r\nearly 2010, in response to an attempt to hack its servers and the\r\ncumulative pressure of growing need to censor its search results,\r\nGoogle announced its withdrawal from China. In March 2010, Google\r\nstopped censoring search results in China, rerouting traffic to its site\r\nin Hong Kong—the other side of the “Great Firewall of China”—and\r\nsignaling its exit from the market.35\r\neBay, Yahoo, and Google had all recognized that China’s\r\nInternet market would become massive. But as the market grew, so\r\ndid regulatory barriers and the competitive challenge from\r\nentrepreneurial and well-financed companies like Alibaba, Baidu, and\r\nTencent.\r\nSpeaking in 2015, Jerry Yang took stock of the China Internet\r\nmarket: “Maybe in the next ten years some American or Western\r\nbrands will be successful in China. But in that 2000–2010 time frame\r\nthere just weren’t any.”\r\nWestern Internet companies trying to crack the China market\r\ncame to experience firsthand the old adage that in China “it is better\r\nto be a merchant than a missionary.” And the biggest merchant of all\r\nwas Alibaba.\r\nChapter Eleven\r\nGrowing Pains\r\nIf you own a hundred percent of the business that cannot operate,\r\nyou own a hundred percent of zero.\r\n—Joe Tsai\r\nWhen eBay exited the China market in 2006, Taobao’s users were 30\r\nmillion. Within three years they were 170 million, and sales on the\r\nTaobao’s platform had grown from $2 billion to $30 billion. With no\r\nobvious competitor on the horizon, the outlook for Alibaba looked\r\nrosy. The Chinese economy was growing at an unprecedented rate,\r\ntopping 14 percent in 2007. Anticipation about the 2008 Olympic\r\nGames in Beijing set off a massive stock market rally at home.\r\nWestern capital poured into China and the share prices of the\r\ncountry’s leading Internet players took off. Baidu’s stock trebled in\r\n2007, valuing the company at over $13 billion. Tencent, with more\r\nthan 740 million QQ instant messaging users and a growing games\r\nbusiness, climbed to $13.5 billion. A new wave of China Internet\r\ncompanies prepared to go public. Speculation turned to Alibaba.\r\nWhen would it IPO?\r\nBefore raising fresh capital, Alibaba reshaped its management1\r\nin preparation for a new phase, beefing up its team with new\r\nexecutives from Pepsi, Walmart, and KPMG2 and a new head of\r\nstrategy, Dr. Zeng Ming. Alibaba also appointed a Shanghai-born\r\nexecutive, David Wei (Wei Zhe), with experience in finance and retail,\r\nas CEO of the B2B business Alibaba.com. He would serve as CEO of\r\nAlibaba.com for more than four years,3 including overseeing Alibaba’s\r\nfirst IPO.\r\nTaobao was wildly popular with consumers, but a commitment to\r\nfree listings ensured that the business was still loss-making. So,\r\ninstead, Alibaba decided to list only its original B2B business:\r\nAlibaba.com.4 Founded in 1999, these companies were now eight\r\nyears old. Alibaba.com had more than 25 million registered users in\r\nChina and overseas. It was a stable and profitable, if unexciting,\r\nbusiness.\r\nIPO 1.0\r\nYet such was the buzz around Jack that the November 2007 IPO of\r\nAlibaba.com in Hong Kong generated a frenzy of interest in the stock\r\nnot seen since the dot-com boom. One analyst slammed the\r\npsychology of Hong Kong investors who “trade stocks like they’re\r\nplaying at the baccarat table.” That was an accurate description of\r\nmany of the individuals who lined up to buy the shares, such as sixtyfive-\r\nyear-old Lai Ah-yung, who told the Associated Press: “People\r\nsaid buy, so I buy.”\r\nAlthough the B2B business of Alibaba.com was really a\r\nsideshow, excitement about China’s booming Internet—now\r\nnumbering more than 160 million users—and its vibrant economy\r\nmeant that few people bothered to make the distinction.\r\nJack described Alibaba’s business in language that resonated\r\nwell in Hong Kong, a market obsessed with property speculation:\r\n“We’re almost like a real estate developer,” he explained. “We make\r\nsure the space is cleared, the pipes are laid, the utilities work. People\r\ncan come in and put up their buildings on our site.” But there was\r\nmuch more to come, he said, adding that if Alibaba did things right\r\n“we have the chance to build a platform that could become the\r\nInternet ecosystem for all of China.”\r\nThe bulk of the shares were sold to institutional investors in an\r\nexhausting, ten-day global road show that finished up in San\r\nFrancisco. The schedule was so packed that David Wei had no time\r\nto eat. Jack unexpectedly ducked out of their last investor meeting,\r\ncalling David soon after to invite him to an airport restaurant where\r\nhe’d ordered all the noodle dishes on the menu.\r\nWhen they landed back in Hong Kong, they already knew from\r\ntheir road show that the offering would be a blowout success. The\r\nstock market there had already rallied 40 percent in the previous\r\nthree months, but to ensure a strong start Yahoo had committed to\r\nbuy5 10 percent of the offering, along with seven other “cornerstone”\r\ninvestors, including local real estate tycoons.6\r\nThe offering of Alibaba.com, listing under the lucky number stock\r\nticker “1688,” sold 19 percent of the company for $1.7 billion. It was\r\nthe largest Internet IPO since Google in 2004, and valued7 the\r\ncompany at almost $9 billion.\r\nDemand from individual investors, who were allocated 25\r\npercent of the total, outstripped supply by 257 to 1. Those lucky\r\nenough to secure an allocation of shares saw them triple on the first\r\nday from the HK$13.5 offer price, closing at HK$39.5. Alibaba’s B2B\r\nbusiness was valued at $26 billion, a multiple of 300 times its\r\nearnings.\r\nBut the luckiest investors were those who sold right away, since\r\nthe share price fell 17 percent the next day.\r\nThe buzz around Alibaba was focused on Jack and the other\r\nhigh-growth businesses like Taobao and Alipay. But these assets\r\nweren’t part of the IPO; in fact most of the shares released in the IPO\r\nwere from Alibaba.com’s parent, Alibaba Group, which needed to\r\nraise cash to support them.\r\nDavid Wei later looked back on the IPO and said, “Taobao was\r\nstill burning money.” From Yahoo’s 2005 investment, Alibaba still had\r\n“maybe $300 to $400 million, but that was not enough. We still didn’t\r\nknow how to monetize Taobao.” Of the $1.7 billion raised in Hong\r\nKong, only $300 million went to the B2B business. Alibaba had\r\ntopped up its coffers with the remaining $1.4 billion, giving it reserves\r\nof almost $1.8 billion. “That’s an enormous war chest,” David recalled,\r\n“and would last us a very long time to support Taobao. At that time\r\nAlipay was still burning money as well.”\r\nThe former Alibaba.com CEO added that the 2007 IPO gave him\r\ntwo insights into Jack’s approach. The first was something that Jack\r\nhad often told him: “Raise money when we don’t need it. When you\r\nneed it don’t go out to raise money, it’s too late.” The second was that\r\nthe IPO allowed Alibaba to take care of its employees: “Jack\r\nunderstands people more than any business. He knows business\r\nwell, but if you ask me the three skills Jack has amongst people,\r\nbusiness, or IT? IT is the worst. Business second. First is people.”\r\nAlibaba’s B2B business was eight years old. Jack knew that he\r\nneeded to give his employees an opportunity to cash in their shares.\r\nDavid remembers Jack telling his employees, “You need to buy a\r\nhouse. You need to buy a car. You can’t wait to sell the stock to get\r\nmarried, to have a baby. Selling the stock doesn’t mean you don’t like\r\nthe business. I encourage you to sell some, to build your life, to give a\r\nreward to your family. Because you have been working too hard,\r\nyou’ve been away from your family. They need some reward.”\r\nJack himself didn’t sell shares for the first two years. But when\r\nhe did sell, some $35 million worth, he explained to his colleagues he\r\nwanted to give his family “a little sense of accomplishment.” But Jack\r\ndidn’t wait to buy himself a $36 million home8 in Hong Kong.\r\nJack’s fame was cemented with the Alibaba.com IPO: Jack’s Australian pen pal, David\r\nMorley, at the Hangzhou Airport, 2008. David Morley and Grit Kaeding\r\nThe IPO prospectus listed Jack’s home address as the small\r\nLakeside Gardens apartment where it had all started. But now he\r\nwould trade up to deluxe apartment in the sky, atop the Mid-Levels\r\ndistrict on the hillside of Hong Kong’s famous Victoria Peak.\r\nJack had become a billionaire (based on the value of his stock),\r\nbut the IPO prospectus illustrated—thanks to the three big investment\r\nrounds led by Goldman Sachs, then SoftBank and Yahoo—how much\r\nsmaller a stake he held in his company than many of his peers. At\r\ntheir IPOs, William Ding held a 59 percent stake in NetEase and\r\nRobin Li a 25 percent stake in Baidu.\r\nGlobal Financial Crisis: Silver Lining\r\nBut storm clouds were gathering that would send the company’s\r\nshares into a tailspin. Alibaba.com depended on foreign trade, but the\r\nU.S. economy was weakening, hitting the business of the China\r\nexporters who made up the backbone of the B2B business. Alibaba’s\r\nshares started to slide, dipping below the IPO price in March. When\r\nthe global financial crisis gathered pace in September 2008,\r\ntriggering the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Alibaba’s shares\r\nplummeted, hitting a low of only one-third of its IPO price the\r\nfollowing month. Only weeks after Beijing had staged the Olympic\r\nGames, it was facing a crisis as global trade volumes plummeted by\r\n40 percent.\r\nAlibaba’s B2B business was vulnerable. It had an impressive\r\nsounding 25 million registered users, but only a handful paid to use\r\nthe website. Just 22,000 subscribers of its Gold Supplier service\r\naccounted for 70 percent of total revenues.9\r\nAs CEO of Alibaba.com, David Wei was expecting the falling\r\nshare price would trigger a lot of pressure from Jack. But, he\r\nremembers, “Jack never picked up the phone or came to see me\r\nabout the share price. Never once. He never talked about profit\r\ngrowth.” But there was one occasion when he did experience Jack’s\r\nwrath. “The only time he ever called me after midnight was when our\r\nteam changed the website a little bit. He was shouting, the only time\r\nhe ever shouted at me. I had never heard him so angry. ‘Are you\r\ncrazy?’” Jack wasn’t yelling at him about the stock price. He was\r\nangry about downgrading in prominence a long-standing discussion\r\nforum set up for traders to chat with one another. Jack demanded\r\nDavid move it back the next day. David pushed back, saying that\r\nAlibaba needed to focus on transactions, not discussions, adding that\r\nthe space on the home page was very valuable for advertisers. But\r\nJack was emphatic: “We are a B2B marketplace. Nobody comes to\r\ntrade every day. We are more important a community than our\r\nmarketplace. The same for Taobao; nobody comes to shop every\r\nday. If you downgrade this forum you are focusing too much on\r\nprofits. Switch it back to a non-revenue-generating entry point to the\r\nbusiness community.”\r\nAlthough its share price took a beating, Alibaba would survive\r\nthe global financial crisis. And, as with SARS five years earlier, the\r\ncrisis created some unexpected dividends for the company.\r\nFirst, Jack realized that the downturn gave him a way to increase\r\nthe loyalty of his paying customers. He initiated a dramatic reduction\r\nin the cost of their subscriptions, telling David, “Let’s be responsible\r\nto our customers. They are paying fifty thousand yuan; we can give\r\nthem thirty thousand yuan back.”\r\n“The stock market went crazy,” David recalled, as investors\r\ncalled him up to complain, “What? You’re losing sixty percent of your\r\nrevenue.” But there was a method to Jack’s madness. Jack was\r\nserious about putting the customer first, but David emphasized Jack\r\nwas not espousing “an ideology of ‘let’s give everything for free.’”\r\nInstead, Jack was “always trying to understand how to get the money\r\nback later. He’s just not greedy about getting the money first.”\r\nLooking back on the price cut, David concluded that the move was\r\nwell timed. “Revenues didn’t drop at all. Customer volume growth\r\noffset the price drop completely. And after the financial crisis was over\r\nwe didn’t raise the prices. We created an opportunity to sell them\r\nmore value-added services, more of an Internet-style model. Jack\r\nactually told me he wanted to change it anyway. The crisis gave him\r\nthe opportunity.”\r\nThe second dividend was that the collapse in their traditional\r\nexport markets forced China’s factory owners to prioritize consumers\r\nat home instead. Increasingly goods “Made in China” for export would\r\nbe “Sold in China” too. Taobao was perfectly positioned to benefit\r\nfrom this switch. Jonathan Lu, then president of Taobao, commented,\r\n“More and more consumers are flocking to the Internet in search of\r\ncheaper goods amid the economic slowdown, while many others\r\nchoose to open online shops as secondary jobs.” By the end of 2009,\r\nTaobao’s market share had climbed to nearly 80 percent.\r\nFinally, Taobao started to generate meaningful revenues, selling\r\nmerchants advertising space10 to help them promote their goods to\r\nthe surging number of online shoppers.11\r\nBy September 2009, Alibaba was on a roll. At Alibaba’s tenth\r\nanniversary celebration Bill Clinton was back in Hangzhou as a\r\nkeynote speaker, but this time with iconic figures for China’s new\r\nconsumer wave, such as Nike-wearing NBA player Kobe Bryant and\r\nthe CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz. At the celebration, Alibaba\r\nalso launched its new cloud computing subsidiary, Aliyun.\r\nAs Taobao gained momentum, it was becoming Alibaba’s main\r\nfocus. Consumer e-commerce was outshining the company’s legacy\r\nB2B business—which Alibaba was to later delist12 from the Hong\r\nKong stock market—and the fading Yahoo China portal asset.\r\nKobe Bryant presents Jack with a pair of his Nike sneakers in Hangzhou, September 2009.\r\nAlibaba\r\nSince the 2005 deal, as Taobao grew in strength Alibaba and\r\nYahoo enjoyed a long honeymoon. But a surprise event in early 2008\r\nbrought that to a dramatic end. On January 31, 2008, Microsoft made\r\nan unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo for $44.6 billion.13 If the deal went\r\nthrough, Jack realized, Microsoft would become his biggest\r\nshareholder. Although he had a good relationship with Bill Gates,\r\nJack realized that in Microsoft he would have a very different partner\r\nto contend with, one known to get much more involved in the\r\ncompanies it invested in than Yahoo did. There was another risk: The\r\nChinese government had contacted Alibaba for comment about the\r\npossible change in ownership.\r\nControl Concerns\r\nMicrosoft and the Chinese government have long enjoyed an\r\nunpredictable, love/hate relationship. High points include the red\r\ncarpet treatment President Jiang Zemin gave to Bill Gates on his visit\r\nto China in 2003 and the return favor Bill Gates gave to newly minted\r\npresident Hu Jintao at a dinner hosted by Bill Gates at his home on\r\nMercer Island, Washington, in 2006. But there had been tensions,\r\ntoo, with Microsoft expressing its exasperation at the rampant\r\npiracy14 of its products and the Chinese government accusing\r\nMicrosoft of monopolistic behavior.\r\nIn public, Jack insisted that Alibaba would remain independent\r\nregardless of what happened with the bid. “Alibaba has been\r\nindependent for nine years. . . . No matter what happens, we will go\r\nin our own way.”\r\nBut in private, he was alarmed. Alibaba wanted to trigger the\r\n“right of first offer” clause in the 2005 deal, which allowed it to buy\r\nback Yahoo’s stake in the event of a change of ownership, as now\r\nappeared likely. Alibaba hired Deutsche Bank and legal advisers to\r\nprepare. But in early 2008, as the global economy weakened, raising\r\nfinance would be difficult, and Alibaba was a company with many\r\nmoving parts. Taobao and Alipay were growing rapidly but still losing\r\nmoney. The listed company, Alibaba.com, was dropping in value. But\r\nif Alibaba couldn’t raise the money or agree on a price with Yahoo to\r\nbuy back its stake, the 2005 deal stipulated that the price would be\r\ndetermined by arbitration instead—a long and unpredictable process.\r\nIn the end, in May 2008, Jerry Yang—now Yahoo CEO since the\r\ndeparture of Terry Semel the previous year—rejected Microsoft’s\r\noffer. Investors in Yahoo were furious, as management had turned\r\ndown an offer that valued the company at a 70 percent premium.\r\nYahoo’s share price started to drop, losing 20 percent in one day.\r\nShareholder activists15 built up stakes in the company in an effort to\r\nforce through the deal, but to no avail. When the global financial crisis\r\nhit a few months later, Jerry’s decision to reject the Microsoft bid\r\nlooked like the height of folly. Investors called for his head. In\r\nNovember 17, 2008, Jerry announced he was stepping down as\r\nCEO, handing the reins over to Carol Bartz, the former CEO of\r\nsoftware firm Autodesk.\r\nYahoo’s decision to reject Microsoft had cost Jerry Yang his job\r\nand dented his pride. Yet Alibaba had dodged a bullet, the uncertainty\r\nof an interloper intruding on its relationship with Yahoo, which, now\r\non the back foot with investors, would continue to be its largest\r\nshareholder.\r\nAny sense of relief, though, would evaporate a few months later\r\nwhen Jerry’s replacement, Carol Bartz, took up her position as CEO\r\nof Yahoo.\r\nBartz was in many ways the opposite of Yang. Jerry Yang was\r\nknown as well mannered, amicable, even deferential. But Bartz was\r\ninfamous for her aggressive style, frequently dropping the F-bomb in\r\nmeetings.\r\nWhen Jack and a delegation of his senior Alibaba executives\r\ntraveled to Yahoo’s headquarters in Sunnyvale in March 2009 he was\r\nmet at the entrance by Jerry.16 He welcomed them, then walked them\r\nto their meeting with Bartz. But on arriving Jerry made his excuses\r\nand left the room: Bartz was in charge now.\r\nAlibaba proceeded to give Yahoo an update on the progress of\r\nthe company, including the runaway growth of Taobao. But rather\r\nthan congratulating them, Bartz lambasted Alibaba for the dwindling\r\nmarket presence of Yahoo in China under their watch, reportedly\r\ntelling them, “I’m going to be blunt because that’s my reputation. . . . I\r\nwant you to take our name off that site.” Jack later told a journalist,17\r\n“If you cannot make the business cool, you have no right to be angry\r\nwith me.”\r\nThe relationship between Jack and Bartz had instantly become\r\nfrosty. Soon there were long periods when the two had no contact\r\nwith each other at all.\r\nAlibaba’s efforts to buy back Yahoo’s stake would increasingly\r\ntake place in public, as did their ongoing disputes.\r\nIn September 2009, at the same time as Alibaba was celebrating\r\nits tenth anniversary, in a public vote of no confidence Yahoo sold18\r\nthe shares it had purchased in the Alibaba.com IPO. Then, in January\r\n2010, as Google faced off with the Chinese government in a bitter\r\nspat over censorship and hacking, Yahoo came out in support of\r\nGoogle: “We condemn any attempts to infiltrate company networks to\r\nobtain user information. . . . We stand aligned with Google that these\r\nkind of attacks are deeply disturbing and strongly believe that the\r\nviolation of user privacy is something that we as Internet pioneers\r\nmust all oppose.”\r\nAlibaba was livid to see its biggest shareholder square off\r\nagainst the Chinese government. Through a spokesman, John\r\nSpelich, Alibaba fired back, “Alibaba Group has communicated to\r\nYahoo that Yahoo’s statement that it is ‘aligned’ with the position\r\nGoogle took last week was reckless given the lack of facts in\r\nevidence. . . . Alibaba doesn’t share this view.”\r\nWorse was yet to come. In September 2010, Yahoo’s Hong Kong\r\nmanaging director said he was seeking mainland Chinese advertisers\r\nfor the site, putting Yahoo in competition with Alibaba, which\r\nresponded that they would reevaluate their relationship with Yahoo.\r\nAlibaba.com CEO David Wei publicly questioned the relationship\r\nwith Yahoo: “Why do we need a financial investor with no business\r\nsynergy or technology?” He added, “The biggest thing that has\r\nchanged is Yahoo lost its own search engine technology. The biggest\r\nreason for a partnership doesn’t exist.”\r\nThe relationship with Alibaba would never improve under Carol\r\nBartz, who was fired by Yahoo in September 2011. But before she\r\nstepped down, Alibaba was buffeted by two crises that threatened to\r\nerode the company’s most precious commodity: trust.\r\nThe first crisis was an internal incident, the discovery of fraud\r\nwithin Alibaba’s B2B business, which damaged Alibaba.com’s\r\nreputation with its customers. The second was the controversy over\r\nthe transfer of the Alipay asset outside Alibaba ownership, which\r\ndamaged Alibaba Group’s reputation with some of its investors.\r\nThe fraud, in which an estimated one hundred Alibaba sales\r\npersonnel were implicated, involved 2,300 merchant storefronts19\r\nwho were certified as trusted suppliers by the corrupt employees. The\r\nmerchants then took in $2 million in payments for orders of\r\ncomputers and other goods on alibaba.com—bestselling items that\r\nwere offered at very low prices—that they never shipped to the\r\ncustomers overseas.\r\nAlibaba outed itself, sending its shares down by 8 percent, but\r\nJack was most angry about the damage it had done to consumers\r\ntrust. The salespeople were fired, and the accounts of more than\r\n1,200 paying members were terminated. Although an investigation\r\ncleared the senior management of any wrongdoing, because the\r\nfraud happened on their watch Jack asked for the resignation of CEO\r\nDavid Wei and the company’s COO.20 Jack told the media that\r\nAlibaba is “probably the only company in China” where senior\r\nmanagement takes responsibility, which prompted Forbes to describe\r\nJack as “something of a rare species” in a nation “steeped in\r\ncorruption.” When some accused him that the dismissal of the senior\r\nexecutives was a publicity stunt, Jack responded angrily, “I’m not the\r\nguy who created the cancer, I’m the guy curing it!”\r\nDavid Wei didn’t oppose the move, crediting it as helping spur a\r\nsimilar crackdown within Taobao shortly after. “People said, ‘Wow it’s\r\nthat serious?’” he told me. “And this triggered other cleanups within\r\nthe group. It started within B2B, then to consumers. I feel very proud\r\nof my resignation. Without cleaning up the business, the IPO in 2014\r\nwould not have been so successful.”\r\nBut the other crisis, impacting its investors, would have a more\r\npernicious and long-lasting impact on Alibaba’s reputation. Even\r\nthough the company insists it did nothing wrong, a position that many\r\ninvestors support, the controversy continues to serve as a lightning\r\nrod to the company’s critics. This crisis centered on who owned the\r\nAlipay business.\r\nFirestorm\r\nAlipay was a critical cog in the Taobao machine, handling more than\r\n$700 million a day in transactions, more than half of the total market\r\nin China. As it was so integral to Alibaba, it was hard to put a value\r\non the business, but one analyst estimated that Alipay was worth $1\r\nbillion.\r\nBut on May 10, 2011, it emerged that the Alipay asset had\r\nactually been transferred out of Alibaba Group the previous year. The\r\nbusiness was now owned by a company, personally controlled by\r\nJack, called Zhejiang Alibaba E-Commerce Company Limited. Jack\r\nowned 80 percent of the company, and Alibaba cofounder Simon Xie\r\n(Xie Shihuang) held the rest. Investors first got wind of the transfer in\r\na paragraph buried on page eight of the notes to Yahoo’s quarterly\r\nearnings report. It read:\r\nTo expedite obtaining an essential regulatory license, the\r\nownership of Alibaba Group’s online payment business, Alipay,\r\nwas restructured so that a hundred percent of its outstanding\r\nshares are held by a Chinese domestic company which is\r\nmajority owned by Alibaba Group’s chief executive officer.\r\nAlibaba Group’s management and its principal shareholders,\r\nYahoo and Softbank Corporation, are engaged in ongoing\r\ndiscussions regarding the terms of the restructuring and the\r\nappropriate commercial arrangements related to the online\r\npayment business.\r\nA business potentially worth $1 billion just went missing?\r\nInvestors were alarmed. Yahoo’s shares dropped like a stone—losing\r\n7 percent on May 11 and 6 percent the day after—wiping $3 billion off\r\nits equity market capitalization. That evening, in an effort to limit the\r\ndamage, Yahoo disclosed that neither it nor SoftBank had been told\r\nabout the transfer of control until after the fact.\r\nBut ignorance wasn’t much of a defense. In Yahoo’s 2005\r\ninvestment agreement, any transfer of assets or subsidiaries out of\r\nAlibaba Group that were worth more than $10 million required the\r\napproval of the company’s board of directors or shareholders.\r\nAt Alibaba.com’s annual general meeting in Hong Kong, Jack\r\ndefended the transfer, arguing it was “a hundred percent legal and a\r\nhundred percent transparent.” He added that discussions were\r\nongoing with Yahoo and SoftBank “regarding the appropriate\r\ncommercial arrangements related to the Alipay business,” adding, “if\r\nwe had not been doing everything aboveboard, we would not be\r\nwhere we are today.”\r\nAlibaba also released a statement confirming the transfer and\r\nexplaining that it was made to comply with regulations from the\r\nPeople’s Bank of China (PBOC), China’s banking regulator.\r\nSpecifically the PBOC had issued its “administrative measures for the\r\npayment services provided by nonfinancial institutions,” which\r\nrequired, Alibaba explained, that “absolute controlling stakes of nonfinancial\r\ninstitutions must be domestically held.”\r\nOn May 15, in an attempt to calm the waters after days of\r\nturmoil, Alibaba and Yahoo issued a joint statement: “Alibaba Group,\r\nand its major stockholders Yahoo Inc. and Softbank Corporation, are\r\nengaged in and committed to productive negotiations to resolve the\r\noutstanding issues related to Alipay in a manner that serves the\r\ninterests of all shareholders as soon as possible.”\r\nBut there was a gap between the public statements from Yahoo\r\nand Alibaba, opening up a series of troubling questions that were\r\nessentially: Who knew what? When?\r\nAlibaba said the Alipay transfer had already happened. But\r\nYahoo hadn’t informed its shareholders for months, perhaps even\r\nyears. How long had Yahoo (and SoftBank) known about the\r\ntransfer? Alibaba insisted that Yahoo and SoftBank had been told in a\r\nJuly 2009 board meeting that “majority shareholding in Alipay had\r\nbeen transferred21 into Chinese ownership.” The Chinese business\r\npublication Caixin confirmed, after an investigation, that Alipay was\r\nsold in two transactions, in June 2009 and August 2010, to Zhejiang\r\nAlibaba E-Commerce Company Limited, the firm controlled by Jack.\r\nThe total price paid was 330 million yuan ($51 million). Critics argued\r\nthat Yahoo was either dishonest or incompetent. If Yahoo knew about\r\nthe transfer, why hadn’t they told their investors? If they didn’t know\r\nabout it, why not?\r\nOther troubling questions were also raised by the crisis. Did\r\nAlibaba really have no choice but to transfer such an important asset\r\nout of the company? Furthermore, did that transfer have to be made\r\nto a company under Jack’s personal control? And what was going to\r\nhappen next?\r\nShareholders in Yahoo were exasperated, with one hedge fund\r\nmanager telling the media, “It seems like this thing has evolved into a\r\nhe-said, she-said battle via press releases. It doesn’t make Yahoo’s\r\nboard look like they were on top of things.”\r\nCritics of the VIE structure, and of investing in Chinese\r\ncompanies in general, were having a field day. But did Alibaba in fact,\r\nas it was arguing, have no choice but to make the transfer?\r\nBehind the scenes, when the crisis first broke Jerry Yang was\r\nupset, but he remained calm. Masayoshi Son, however, was\r\nincensed. What was Jack thinking? To figure out what was going on,\r\nJerry offered to fly to Beijing. Meeting there with a senior official at the\r\nPBOC, he was told that it was best he just “accept the situation.”\r\nWhen he pressed for an explanation, he was simply informed that the\r\nmatter was “out of their hands.”\r\nIt was true that PBOC had introduced new rules, in June 2010,\r\ngoverning domestic third-party payment platforms on the Internet.\r\nThe rules set out a longer application procedure for foreign-funded\r\ncompanies than for wholly domestically owned applicants. PBOC had\r\nbeen debating the issue of foreign ownership of payment companies\r\nsince 2005. But the rules did not exclude foreign ownership entirely.\r\nJack’s defenders argue that he was simply first to see which way\r\nthe regulatory wind was blowing. Parking the Alipay asset into a\r\ndomestic company that he controlled could insulate Alibaba from the\r\nrisk that new licenses expected to be issued by PBOC would be\r\ndenied to foreign-invested companies. In an effort to clear up the\r\nmatter in 2014 ahead of its IPO, Alibaba justified the transfer by\r\nexplaining that the “action enabled Alipay to obtain a payment\r\nbusiness license in May 2011 without delay and without any\r\ndetrimental impact to our China retail marketplaces or to Alipay.”\r\nIndeed, on May 26, 2011, Alipay, now entirely domestically\r\nowned, was the first of twenty-seven companies to be issued\r\nlicenses22 and was awarded license number 001. But Jack’s critics\r\ncharge that because PBOC also issued licenses to foreign-invested\r\ncompanies, such as Tencent’s Tenpay, and was the number two\r\nplayer in the market, then the argument that Alibaba had to transfer\r\nownership of Alipay out of foreign hands doesn’t hold water. To this,\r\nJack’s defenders argue that the comparison with Tenpay and other\r\nforeign-invested companies isn’t valid: Alipay already had such a\r\ndominant share of the market that it could not have expected such\r\nleniency. There were thousands of companies active in the third-party\r\npayment market, but with the first batch of licenses issued in May,\r\nPBOC also issued a deadline—September 1, 2011—for all\r\ncompanies to either obtain their own licenses or merge with an\r\nexisting license holder. Inevitably this generated a lot of tension.\r\nCompanies that had operated in a gray area now found themselves\r\nbeing divided into black and white, based on whether they had\r\nforeign investment and had obtained a license. Those that had not\r\nyet received licenses faced the risk of going out of business, and\r\nthose that had received licenses but were foreign-invested were\r\nconcerned that Alipay’s move threatened their own ability to have\r\nIPOs in the future, damaging the valuation of their business and,\r\nmany feared, undermining the VIE investment structure on which so\r\nmany Internet companies relied.\r\nA number of Alipay’s rivals described to me a meeting hosted by\r\nPBOC soon after the licenses were issued, at which Jack was\r\npresent. Many vented their unhappiness at Alibaba, but Jack\r\nremained silent. Yet even without the licensing issue, the reality was\r\nthat too many companies were chasing after the oasis of fortunes to\r\nbe made in payment riches. This turned out to be a mirage: With fees\r\nas low as 1 percent of transactions, if licensing hadn’t thinned out the\r\nfield, then competition would have done the job anyway. In this light,\r\nthe Alipay incident—and the PBOC licensing regime it triggered—\r\nmerely accelerated the inevitable: Many payment companies found\r\nthemselves stranded in the desert, soon to run out of funding. One\r\nexecutive summed it up for me: “There were more ‘payment solution’\r\ncompanies out there than consumer e-commerce companies. It was\r\nlike being in a kitchen where there were more chefs than diners in the\r\nrestaurant.”\r\nIn light of all of this, was Jack justified in making the transfer of\r\nAlipay to his control? Or are those who, to this day, criticize the\r\ntransfer justified? Both sides of the argument relied on their\r\ninterpretation of what the Chinese government, in the form of PBOC,\r\nhad in mind. But that was clear as mud. PBOC had never said that\r\nforeign-invested entities could own payment platforms. But equally it\r\nhad never said that they could not. One influential investor I spoke\r\nwith summed it up: “PBOC were pissed. But Jack was very skilled at\r\nplaying off different factions. No one could do anything about it\r\nbecause PBOC’s rules were so vague to start with.”\r\nWas something else going on that drove Jack to take the risky\r\nmove of transferring Alipay out of Alibaba? The deteriorating\r\nrelationship between Yahoo and Alibaba certainly didn’t help. Under\r\nCarol Bartz, relations had become so bad that she and Jack were not\r\neven on speaking terms. Instead they started to communicate with\r\neach other by issuing statements or in interviews with the media.\r\nEight months before the Alipay crisis erupted, Bartz stated that\r\nshe had no interest in selling Yahoo’s stake in Alibaba and that Jack\r\nwas merely trying to get “some of his stock back” ahead of an IPO\r\nthat would value those shares much higher. Alibaba immediately fired\r\nback, via the media, denying any plans to get an IPO and laying out\r\nits efforts at good faith negotiations23 with Yahoo to buy back its\r\nstake.\r\nThe reality for Alibaba, though, was that if Yahoo didn’t like the\r\nprice Alibaba was prepared to pay there was little Jack could do\r\nabout it.\r\nDid this frustration play a role? Or was another looming issue the\r\nreason? Five years had passed since Yahoo’s investment. Part of the\r\ninvestment agreement, conceded to by Alibaba only after intensive\r\nnegotiations, gave Yahoo the right to appoint a second director to\r\nAlibaba’s board in 2010. Furthermore, the agreement also stipulated\r\nthat a majority of the board could replace Alibaba’s senior\r\nmanagement. If a hostile Bartz gained the support of Jerry Yang, who\r\nalthough no longer CEO still sat on Alibaba’s board, and enlisted the\r\nsupport of Masayoshi Son, she could outvote Jack and Joe,\r\nimperiling their positions. This was improbable—given Jack’s\r\nrelationship with Jerry and Masayoshi Son, not to mention the\r\ndifficulty for a foreign company to try to gain control over such an\r\niconic company as Alibaba—but not impossible, especially if Bartz\r\ncould strengthen her hand in negotiations over a sale of Yahoo’s\r\nstake. Yet even threatening such a move would have been highly\r\ndestructive for Yahoo. “Then their investment would be worthless” is\r\nhow another China Internet founder I spoke with put it.\r\nIn any case, the “nuclear option” never happened. As criticism of\r\nthe transfer mounted Alibaba had little choice but to reach an\r\nagreement with Yahoo as quickly as possible. A number of domestic\r\ncommentators were even harsher than foreign critics. In their eyes,\r\nthe dispute threatened the interests of other entrepreneurs in China\r\nby undermining confidence in the VIE structure, and foreign\r\ninvestment in the country in general. After first criticizing the\r\ngovernment for the vague and lengthy approval process for licensing\r\npayment providers, respected local magazine Caixin slammed Jack\r\npersonally for “violating contract principles that support the market\r\neconomy.” Jack had tarnished his international business reputation\r\nand diminished Alibaba’s long-term growth prospects, Caixin argued,\r\nby transferring an asset “to a concern under his name, for a price too\r\nlow to be fair.” One China Internet company founder I spoke with, four\r\nyears after the controversy, told me that even if that was the\r\nmotivation, Jack was justified in doing it: “I perfectly understand it. Is it\r\nright? If I were Jack, I would have done the same thing. If he hadn’t\r\nresolved the incentive problem, Alibaba wouldn’t be today’s Alibaba.”\r\nAlthough few Chinese business leaders publicly endorsed that view, a\r\nnumber posted links to the Caixin article on social media.\r\nSoon after its publication, Jack communicated with Hu Shuli,\r\nCaixin’s influential editor-in-chief, through a flurry of mobile text\r\nmessages to discuss the issues she had raised. Their first texting\r\nsession lasted two hours. Jack texted her to say he was very\r\ndisappointed that Caixin published the comments without knowing the\r\nwhole picture. He said that he “had no interest in politics at all,” he\r\njust wanted “to be himself” and “to be accountable to himself and to\r\nothers.”\r\nJack said that “today’s situation is not designed [by us], but [we\r\nare] compelled to do it. The complexity of decision making of\r\nshareholders and the board is also a problem of corporate\r\ngovernance in the future.” He added, “I have three principles of doing\r\nthings: first, one hundred percent legal; second, one hundred percent\r\ntransparent; third, I must let the company develop sustainably and\r\nhealthily.”\r\nInterestingly, Jack revealed to Hu that Alibaba’s relationship with\r\nYahoo was stronger at that point than with SoftBank: “The problems\r\nbetween me and Yahoo are easy to solve. They are problems of\r\ninterests. But the issues between me and Masayoshi Son are not\r\nonly issues of interests.” Beyond the Alipay dispute, at the height of\r\nthe controversy, Jack disclosed24 that he had fundamental\r\ndisagreements with Son on a range of HR issues, including employee\r\nincentive schemes and staff training:\r\nHe thinks that employees can be replaced at any time. I\r\nbelieve that we should give opportunities to young people in\r\nChina, sharing the future with them. He thinks that’s not the case\r\nin Japan: I pay you wages anyway, so if you want to do it that’s\r\nfine, but if not there will be others. First of all, I don’t think [what\r\nhappens in] Japan is necessarily right; second, this is totally\r\nwrong in China. I believe customers first, employees second. We\r\nwouldn’t have this company without our staff. We have\r\ncompletely different principles on this issue. . . . The issue has\r\nbeen there since day one.\r\nJack revealed that his disagreement with Son was long-standing,\r\nthat they had been “fighting over it regularly in the past few years.”\r\nJack also contrasted his approach to equity ownership. “Seventeen\r\nthousand employees at Alibaba all have shares,” he said. “You see\r\nthat from the day that Alibaba was established until today, my share\r\nhas been getting smaller and smaller.” Jack argued that Son, by\r\ncontrast, had a stake in Alibaba of “thirty percent from day one, and\r\nnow it is over thirty percent.” In a sign of the tension that had erupted\r\nbetween the two men, he invited journalists to look at Son’s approach\r\nto his own employees at SoftBank: “You can check if he’s given\r\nanything to his employees. . . . If he [Son] is asked to take out one\r\npercent [of his stake], it’s like pulling out a tooth from a live tiger.”\r\nWhile Jack professed his admiration for Son’s skills of\r\nnegotiations, he also said Son is the world’s number one “iron\r\nrooster” (tie gongji), a Chinese idiom describing people who are\r\nextremely stingy: Meaning, there is no chance whatsoever to pull out\r\neven one hair from an iron rooster.\r\nBecause many of the facts were disputed, and the stakes were\r\nso high, efforts to resolve the dispute dragged on for weeks, then\r\nmonths. Midway through the crisis,25 Jack described the negotiations\r\nover the compensation to be paid for the Alipay transfer as “very\r\ncomplicated,” comparing them to “peace talks at the United Nations.”\r\nBut reaching a settlement was becoming urgent. By the end of\r\nJuly, Yahoo’s shares had dropped 22 percent since the dispute\r\nbegan. A few weeks earlier, high-profile investor David Einhorn of\r\nGreenlight Capital sold his entire position in Yahoo, which he had\r\nbuilt up because of its exposure to China, saying that the dispute\r\n“wasn’t what we signed up for.”\r\nFinally, on July 29, an agreement was reached. The transfer of\r\nthe assets would stand. But Yahoo, benefiting through its continued\r\nstake, would receive compensation of $2 to $6 billion from the\r\nproceeds of any future IPO of Alipay. Alibaba, Yahoo, and SoftBank\r\nwere ready to put the dispute behind them. But investors in Yahoo\r\nwere underwhelmed, particularly by the cap of $6 billion,26 and its\r\nshares fell 2.6 percent on the news. But in a call explaining the\r\nagreement to investors Joe Tsai pushed back vigorously, saying that\r\nthe transfer was made to stay in line with government regulations: “If\r\nyou own a hundred percent of the business that cannot operate, you\r\nown a hundred percent of zero.”\r\nThe Alipay episode left a bitter taste, but the compensation\r\nagreement had put an end to months of uncertainty. Now Alibaba\r\ncould focus on its next priority: buying back as much as possible of\r\nYahoo’s stake.\r\nOn September 30, 2011, Jack accepted an invitation to Stanford\r\nUniversity to give a keynote speech at the China 2.0 conference\r\nseries, which I had cofounded with Marguerite Gong Hancock a few\r\nyears earlier. After I had introduced him onstage, I settled into a seat\r\nin the front row to watch what turned out to be a vintage performance\r\nof “Jack Magic.” Speaking in English, Jack started by acknowledging\r\nthe elephant in the room—the company’s relationship with Yahoo. He\r\nsaid he was very tired from the events of the past few months, then,\r\nraising his right hand and looking at the audience, he said, “I still don’t\r\nknow what the VIE is, right?” Of course it was obvious Jack knew all\r\nabout the investment structure—it had been center stage of the\r\nAlipay controversy—but feigning ignorance was his way of winning\r\nover the crowd, even if the lawyers in the audience couldn’t contain\r\ntheir incredulity. Jack then ventured onto safer ground using some of\r\nhis stock stories, before I started to field questions for him from the\r\nmedia. Asked, “Are you going to buy Yahoo?” Jack replied, “Yes,\r\nwe’re very interested in that.” When Kara Swisher of Dow Jones’s\r\nAllThingsD asked him if he wanted to buy back just Yahoo’s stake in\r\nAlibaba, or all of Yahoo, Jack replied, in a sound bite that quickly\r\nwent around the world: “The whole piece. Yahoo China is already\r\nours right?” Then putting his right hand in his pocket he added, “It’s\r\nalready in my pocket!” He concluded by adding that the situation was\r\ncomplex and would take time.\r\nIn the end, it would take nine months before a deal was\r\ncompleted. On May 21, 2012, the terms were made public: Alibaba\r\nwould pay Yahoo $7.1 billion ($6.3 billion in cash and up to $800\r\nmillion in preferred stock) to buy back half of Yahoo’s stake, or 20\r\npercent of Alibaba, netting Yahoo some badly needed cash: $4.2\r\nbillion after tax. Alibaba also made a commitment to buy back a\r\nquarter of Yahoo’s remaining stake by 2015, or let Yahoo sell the\r\nstake in a future IPO27 of Alibaba Group. Yahoo and SoftBank also\r\nagreed to cap their voting rights on Alibaba’s board below 50 percent.\r\nJack and Joe could feel secure in their seats. They set a course for\r\ntheir IPO (2.0).\r\nChapter Twelve\r\nIcon or Icarus?\r\nThe communists just beat us at capitalism!\r\n—Jon Stewart\r\nIPO 2.0\r\nOn September 8, 2014, two days before Jack’s fiftieth birthday,\r\nAlibaba Group Ltd. kicked off its global roadshow in New York City.\r\nFifteen years after climbing the rough, cement staircase inside\r\nthe Lakeside Gardens apartment complex, I walked up the polished\r\nmarble steps of the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan. I had come to\r\nwitness the birth of “BABA.”\r\nLive-broadcast satellite trucks and black SUVs lined the block\r\noutside the hotel. Inside Jack, Joe, and the rest of the senior\r\nmanagement team prepared to make their pitch. I walked alongside a\r\nline of investors that snaked all the way from Forty-Ninth Street up\r\nthrough the lobby to the hotel’s gilded elevators. Today was all about\r\nthe New China. The venue was fitting, as the venerable Waldorf\r\nAstoria itself was acquired1 shortly after, for $2 billion, by a Chinese\r\ncompany.\r\nOn reaching the upstairs ballroom, the investors were issued\r\nwith wristbands that determined whether they would hear the Alibaba\r\npitch in the main ballroom or in one of the overflow rooms outside.\r\nOne investor said it reminded him of an iPhone launch.\r\nAll eyes were on Jack. Although Jonathan Lu, as CEO,2 was the\r\nmain front man for the presentation, Jack remained—as he does\r\ntoday—the personification of Alibaba. When it was his turn, Jack told\r\nthe investors the story of his first, unsuccessful fund-raising trip with\r\nJoe to the United States fifteen years earlier. Seeking $2 million from\r\nventure capitalists, he returned, he said, empty-handed. But now he\r\nwas back, and asking for a little more.\r\nOn that first trip Joe tried, without success, to convince Jack to\r\npresent something to the investors they had flown to the United\r\nStates to meet. But this time they came prepared. Each of the\r\ninvestors was handed a weighty, three-hundred-page prospectus.\r\nThe bright orange cover’s cartoonlike graphics at the front made it\r\nlook more like a children’s book than a serious document for grownups.\r\nBut flipping past the artwork, the investors found the sobering\r\ntext outlining the “Risk Factors”—standard for any public offering. The\r\nsection ran thirty-seven pages long, detailing “intangible”3 and\r\n“tangible” risks, such as the company’s dependence on Alipay, a\r\nbusiness it no longer owned. Jack addressed the issue of the Alipay\r\ntransfer head-on, saying he had been given no choice. The decision,\r\nhe said, was one of the hardest of his life, but one in retrospect he\r\nwould make again.\r\nThe risk factors also included a discussion of the controversial\r\nbut enduring VIE investment structure. But the offering had added, on\r\ntop of the VIE, another layer of complexity for investors: the “Alibaba\r\nPartnership.” The partnership4 comprised thirty individuals, mostly5\r\nmembers of Alibaba’s management team. Six,6 plus Joe Tsai, were\r\noriginal cofounders of Alibaba. The explicit goal of the partnership is\r\nto help Alibaba’s senior managers “collaborate and override\r\nbureaucracy and hierarchy,” to ensure “excellence, innovation, and\r\nsustainability.” In December 2015, Alibaba appointed four new\r\npartnering members, taking the total to thirty-four.7\r\nOf course the implicit reason for the partnership is control. Even\r\nafter becoming a public company, Alibaba wanted to ensure that the\r\nfounders remained masters of their own destiny.\r\nThis had already caused controversy for Alibaba, prompting the\r\nHong Kong Stock Exchange and its regulator8 to turn down Alibaba’s\r\napplication for an IPO in the territory. Hong Kong was concerned that\r\nallowing the structure would signal a weakening of its commitment to\r\nthe “one shareholder, one vote” system.\r\nAlibaba countered that the partnership could not be compared to\r\nthe narrow concentration of control of the “dual-class” or “high vote”\r\nshare structures used by tech company peers in the United States\r\nlike Google and Facebook. Instead it was proposing a new, more\r\nsophisticated form of corporate governance that gave each member\r\nof a larger group of managers a vote. But the distinction failed to\r\nconvince the Hong Kong authorities, and Alibaba opted for an IPO on\r\nthe New York Stock Exchange instead.\r\nSaying “no” to Alibaba was costly for Hong Kong, depriving the\r\ncity’s bankers and lawyers of a huge windfall. Joe Tsai didn’t pull his\r\npunches: “The question Hong Kong must address is whether it is\r\nready to look forward as the rest of the world passes it by.”\r\nSo, Alibaba found itself in New York. Selling 12 percent of the\r\ncompany, it raised $25 billion, the largest IPO in history. Credit Suisse\r\nand Morgan Stanley, two of the six banks hired to lead the deal,\r\nraked in $49 million each. The haul for an army of lawyers on the deal\r\nwas more than $15 million.\r\nIn New York, the deal caught the attention of Jon Stewart at\r\nComedy Central. First he joked about Alibaba’s business, connecting\r\nbuyers with sellers: “Craigslist with better graphics, is that what it is?”\r\nThen he poked fun at Alibaba’s convoluted ownership structure:\r\nInvestors in the IPO were buying shares in Alibaba Group Holdings\r\nLimited, a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, controlled\r\nby a partnership, which did not actually own the business assets in\r\nChina. “So I paid for a share for something on an island, and I don’t\r\nown it?” Stewart continued, “You’re selling us a time share, is that\r\nwhat it is? A time share in a company. Without giving us a free\r\nvacation to sit through your pitch?” Finally, Stewart noted that Alibaba\r\nwas listing in New York because it couldn’t list in China: “The\r\ncommunists just beat us at capitalism!” Stewart concluded by\r\npretending to phone his broker to get his hands on, in vain, some\r\nBABA shares.\r\nBut this IPO9 was not about individual investors; it was all about\r\nbig institutions, for whom ninety percent of the shares were reserved.\r\nSeventeen hundred institutional investors subscribed to the shares,\r\nincluding forty who each put in orders for over $1 billion. In the end\r\nthe bulk of the shares were allocated to just a few dozen institutions.\r\nJack Magic, and the appeal of Alibaba’s huge business, worked.\r\nDemand10 for BABA shares outstripped supply by over fourteen\r\ntimes. A healthy first-day pop was inevitable. Demand was so strong\r\nthat it took the New York Stock Exchange half an hour even to\r\ndetermine the opening trade. The stock was listed at $68 but the\r\ninitial quotes came in at just under $100. BABA closed the day 25\r\npercent higher than the initial price, valuing the company at over $230\r\nbillion, more than Coca-Cola. Among Internet companies, Alibaba\r\nwas second only to Google, higher even than Amazon and Facebook.\r\nIn the following weeks, its shares continued to climb, its valuation far\r\nsurpassing Walmart and Amazon, almost breaking the $300 billion\r\nmark in early November. Mirroring his record-breaking $36 million\r\npurchase of an apartment in Hong Kong after Alibaba.com’s IPO in\r\n2007, less than a year after the 2014 IPO, Jack bought another\r\ntrophy asset, for $190 million this time, in the shape of a tenthousand-\r\nsquare-foot, three-story house perched even higher up\r\nHong Kong’s Victoria Peak.\r\nHowever, just as Alibaba.com’s IPO in 2007 had sizzled, then\r\nfizzled, BABA-boom soon become BABA-bust: Alibaba Group’s\r\nshares sank by 50 percent before the summer of 2015 was out. In\r\nlate August, they fell below the $68 IPO price for the first time. By\r\nSeptember, Alibaba’s valuation had sunk11 by almost $150 billion\r\nfrom its November 2014 peak, in what Bloomberg described as “the\r\nworld’s biggest destruction of market value.”\r\nNewly appointed CEO Daniel Zhang reminded the company’s\r\nemployees, “Our values do not waver with the fluctuations in stock\r\nprice,” and that they were not just fighting a battle, but were “in it for\r\n102 years to win the war.” Thanks to the anticipated future IPO of the\r\nparent company of Alipay, renamed Ant Financial,12 Alibaba would\r\nalso continue its practice of creating regular opportunities for\r\nemployees to cash out some of their shares. Although Ant Financial’s\r\nIPO (on a domestic stock exchange) is likely still a year or two away,\r\nAlibaba has already started to distribute shares in the financial unit.\r\nAfter a strong first few months, why did Alibaba’s shares fall so\r\nfast and so far? The sharpest drop was triggered by a public dispute\r\nbetween Alibaba and a Chinese government agency, a development\r\nthat came as a shock to the foreign investors who had assumed that\r\nJack was somehow the ultimate insider, immune from such\r\nentanglements.\r\nFighting over Fakes\r\nOn January 28, 2015, the State Administration for Industry and\r\nCommerce (SAIC), China’s business and licensing authority, posted a\r\nreport13 on its website that detailed complaints, leveled the previous\r\nJuly, that accused Alibaba of selling fake goods and its employees of\r\ntaking bribes from vendors in order to boost the rankings of their\r\nproducts. The report also detailed a subsequent SAIC investigation\r\ninto the sale of counterfeit items on six leading e-commerce sites,\r\nincluding Taobao and Tmall. The SAIC found that of its sample\r\npurchases on Taobao only 37 percent were considered authentic,\r\nadding, “For a long time, Alibaba hasn’t paid enough attention to the\r\nillegal operations on its platforms, and hasn’t effectively addressed\r\nthe issues.” Worse still, the report asserted that “Alibaba not only\r\nfaces the biggest credibility crisis since its establishment, it also casts\r\na bad influence for other Internet operators trying to operate legally.”\r\nWhen the media picked up the story, Alibaba’s shares fell by\r\nmore than 4 percent.\r\nAlibaba was furious, questioning the SAIC’s methodology and its\r\nmotivations. Remarkably, both the SAIC’s report and Alibaba’s\r\nresponse to it were on full view to the public. In China, discussions\r\nbetween the government and companies are typically conducted in\r\nprivate, as the opacity of PBOC’s intentions and interactions during\r\nthe Alipay crisis had already illustrated. But here was one of China’s\r\nlargest companies directly criticizing the government. More\r\nspectacularly, a posting by a Taobao customer service representative\r\non the company’s official social media14 account even named the\r\nindividual SAIC official15 involved: “Director Liu Hongliang! You’re\r\nbreaking the rules, stop being a crooked referee!” The post\r\ncontinued, “We are willing to accept your God-like existence, but\r\ncannot agree with the double standards used in various sampling\r\nprocedures and your irrational logic.”\r\nAlthough the post was deleted by Alibaba a few hours later, it\r\nwas replaced by an official communication that was still remarkable\r\nfor its frankness: “We are open to fair supervision, and are opposed\r\nto no supervision, misconceived supervision, or supervision with\r\nmalicious aims.” Alibaba also indicated that it had filed a complaint\r\nagainst the SAIC official for misusing procedures and using\r\nerroneous methods to get a “non-objective conclusion,” adding, “We\r\nbelieve Director Liu Hongliang’s procedural misconduct during the\r\nsupervision process, irrational enforcement of the law and obtaining a\r\nbiased conclusion using the wrong methodology has inflicted\r\nirreparable and serious damage to Taobao and Chinese online\r\nbusinesses.”\r\nFor Alibaba the timing of the dispute was particularly\r\ninopportune, coming one day before16 the release of its quarterly\r\nearnings report. Alibaba reported sales of 40 percent,17 but investors\r\nwere unimpressed by its numbers, sending its shares down a further\r\n8.8 percent. Tens of billions of dollars had been wiped off its valuation\r\nin just two days. In the earnings call, Joe Tsai, now executive vice\r\nchairman, fought back: “At Alibaba we believe in fairness. We support\r\nrigorous supervision of our company, but we also feel compelled to\r\nspeak out when there are inaccurate and unfair attacks being leveled\r\nagainst us.”\r\nAnd the tit-for-tat wasn’t over yet. SAIC then disclosed that it had\r\nkept private the details of the July 2014 meeting in order not “to\r\nimpede Alibaba’s preparations for its initial public offering.” This was\r\nparticularly unhelpful to the newly public Alibaba because it raised the\r\nugly possibility that management had failed to disclose the dispute to\r\ninvestors ahead of its IPO, something that should have formed part of\r\nthe (already voluminous) risk factors section of the prospectus. But\r\nAlibaba denied the accusation, saying it neither had prior knowledge\r\nof a white paper nor had requested SAIC to delay publication of any\r\nreport, adding that meetings with regulators were a normal\r\noccurrence. Unsurprisingly all of this triggered a class-action lawsuit\r\nagainst Alibaba the following week.\r\nFinally, the mudslinging had become too much. SAIC deleted the\r\nreport from its website. Jack flew to Beijing to meet with the\r\nregulator’s head, Zhang Mao.18 There the two men, in public at least,\r\nburied the hatchet. Jack promised to “actively cooperate with the\r\ngovernment and devote more technology and capital” to rooting out\r\nthe sale of fake goods. Zhang Mao praised Alibaba for its efforts to\r\nsafeguard consumer interests and said SAIC would look to develop\r\nnew tools to oversee the e-commerce sector.\r\nLooking back at the incident, one former senior Alibaba\r\nexecutive told me the company would have been better off not\r\nresponding to the SAIC announcement in the first place: “Alibaba is\r\nstill relatively young, but to some they’ve become such a big monster.\r\nEven the government doesn’t know how to manage them. In the\r\nfuture, there will be a lot of conflicts. That’s natural. Because this\r\ngovernment has never had to deal with a company this influential.”\r\nFor Alibaba, and any private company, the Chinese government\r\nitself is a multiheaded hydra of agencies, often competing with one\r\nanother for influence, licensing fees, or other forms of rent to justify\r\ntheir existence, often lacking sufficient central government support to\r\nfinance their operations. These agencies exist at both the national\r\nlevel and at multiple levels below. Some are replicated all the way\r\ndown through the provinces to municipalities and finally to the level of\r\nrural counties.\r\nJack often repeats a line about his relationship with the Chinese\r\ngovernment: “Fall in love with the government, don’t marry them—\r\nrespect them.” With so many departments, if he were truly to marry\r\nthe government, he’d end up a polygamist. Jack revealed19 that\r\nAlibaba had hosted in 2014 alone over forty-four thousand visits from\r\nvarious government delegations in China.\r\nYet, short of marrying, even respecting the government can be a\r\nchallenge. Jack once explained to a friend that he was never really\r\nsure of his schedule from one day to the next. If the party secretary of\r\nZhejiang, for example, requested he travel with him as part of a\r\nbusiness delegation to Taiwan, then he would have little choice but to\r\nmake the trip. Owning a Gulfstream G650 jet is quite a privilege, but\r\nunlike his tycoon peers in the West, for Jack there is always a lurking\r\nsense of not knowing where to tell the pilots to fly it.\r\nJack receives Xi Jinping, the Communist Party Secretary of Shanghai, at Alibaba in\r\nHangzhou, July 23, 2007. Alibaba\r\nRespecting the government also involves cultivating good\r\nrelations with a wide range of officials, including future leaders of the\r\ncountry who might one day hold huge sway over the company. A\r\ntypical feature in the lobby of any large company in China, whether\r\nstate or privately owned, is a wall of photos memorializing meetings\r\nbetween the boss and various government dignitaries. Alibaba is no\r\nexception. At the entrance to its VIP visitor suite there is a photo20\r\nfrom July 2007 of Jack welcoming Xi Jinping to Alibaba. Xi today of\r\ncourse is president of China but back then he was Communist Party\r\nsecretary of Shanghai.21\r\nEntrepreneurs in China can never eliminate the risk for their\r\nbusiness of arbitrary regulations or actions. Instead they can try to\r\nshield their companies by helping the government do its job.\r\nPart of the SAIC’s job is to stem the flood of pirated goods.22\r\nOnline or offline, fighting piracy is like a game of Whack-A-Mole:\r\nWhack one molehill, and the moles will pop up somewhere else. To\r\nturn the page on its dispute with SAIC, Alibaba increased the number\r\nof staff dedicated to combating counterfeiting, from 150 to 450\r\npeople, including a team of “secret shoppers” to root out fakes.\r\nAlibaba operates a “three strikes you’re out” system to sanction\r\nvendors. Selling the same fake good on three occasions23 gets a\r\nmerchant kicked off the platform. To weed out merchants who later\r\nresurface with another name—the “whack a mole” problem—Alibaba\r\nhas adopted some creative countermeasures. Similar to the “proof of\r\nlife” tactics used by hostage negotiators, the company asks\r\nmerchants to prove their identities by taking a photo of themselves\r\nwith their ID card and today’s newspaper. They may even ask them to\r\nadopt a particular “pose of the day” in the photo as an extra security\r\nmeasure.\r\nAt a closed-door dinner in London in October 2015, Jack\r\nsummed up the problem as follows: “Maybe one percent of the\r\nmerchants on our platform are bad guys.” Yet with nine million\r\nmerchants on Taobao, that works out at ninety thousand “bad guys.”\r\nAn investor present at the dinner, David Giampaolo, summarized\r\nJack’s message that evening: “He is focused on solving the problem.\r\nHowever, few people, especially overseas, appreciate the enormity of\r\nthe task.”\r\nIn Beijing on Singles’ Day 2015, Jack went further: “Every\r\nconsumer that buys one counterfeit on our site, we lose five\r\ncustomers. We are also victims of [counterfeits]. We hate this thing. . .\r\n. We have been fighting for years, but we are fighting human nature,\r\nhuman instinct.” Explaining that piracy had been rampant in China’s\r\noffline retail sector for the past thirty years, Jack added, “We are\r\nfighting online and helping fighting offline. We have two thousand\r\npeople working on it, we have fifty-seven hundred volunteers working\r\non it. With special task forces, with the technology we have, we are\r\nmaking progress. I think the opportunity is whether we should work\r\ntogether to fight against these thieves. We are running a platform for\r\nmore than ten million businesses. They [the pirates] are tiny; they are\r\neverywhere.” Some of Jack’s rivals are sympathetic to his\r\npredicament. One told me: “When you’re managing a platform with\r\nnine million merchants on it, you’re running a country.”\r\nA key part of Alibaba’s response is its Internet Security Team,\r\nheaded by ex-cop Ni Liang. The team operates a “notification and\r\ntake down” system that merchants can use to flag fake products24\r\nbeing sold on Alibaba’s sites. Using techniques such as “price point\r\nanalysis,” brand owners can identify large quantities of high-margin\r\nitems such as luxury bags being sold at impossibly low prices. But\r\nthis method doesn’t work well for high-volume, low-margin items such\r\nas soap or shampoo, where it can be hard to sort legitimate products\r\nfrom fakes. So Alibaba is looking to the power of Big Data: Company\r\nnames, addresses, trading history, and bank accounts can all be\r\nuseful to establish patterns of distribution and go after infringers. The\r\npower to deny them the use of Alipay as a payment tool on other\r\nplatforms can also be an effective deterrent.\r\nThe reality is that, for piracy, e-commerce is both part of the\r\nproblem and part of the solution. The Internet is more effective at\r\ndistributing fake goods than offline methods, but also more effective\r\nat identifying and combating infringers.\r\nTaobao, dominated by mostly mom-and-pop store owners, is less\r\neasy to police than Tmall. So with events like the November 11\r\nSingles’ Day, Alibaba is spending more marketing dollars on Tmall\r\nthan Taobao. Tmall sets a higher bar25 for merchants to trade. Also\r\nAlibaba generates commission fees on Tmall, meaning that shifting\r\nbusiness away from Taobao makes more money for Alibaba as well.\r\nBut not all brands are convinced. A few months after the SAIC\r\ncontroversy the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA),\r\nwhich represents more than a thousand brands, was again pushing\r\nfor Taobao to be added back to the USTR’s list of notorious markets;\r\nthe association complained about the “rampant proliferation” of fake\r\ngoods on Taobao and the “slow, sluggish, and confusing systems”\r\nthat Alibaba has put in place to remove them. Yet despite AAFA’s\r\naction, a number of its members, including Macy’s and Nordstrom,\r\ncontinue to work closely with Alibaba on initiatives including Singles’\r\nDay, revealing a lack of consensus about the way forward. In\r\nNovember 2015, Juanita Duggan, the person who as CEO and\r\npresident had spearheaded the complaint, resigned from her post.\r\nAlibaba faces criticisms from some brand owners in Europe, too.\r\nIn May 2015, Kering, the French luxury goods holding company of\r\nbrands including Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, filed a lawsuit against\r\nAlibaba alleging violations of its trademarks and racketeering laws.\r\nPart of the complaint included allegations that when customers enter\r\nthe word Gucci in Alibaba’s search engine, it returns links to fake\r\nproducts branded “guchi” or “cucchi.” Alibaba is fighting the suit,\r\ncountering that Kering has “chosen the path of wasteful litigation\r\ninstead of the path of constructive cooperation.” In an interview on\r\nSingles’ Day 2015 with Bloomberg, Jack was even blunter, revealing\r\nhis frustration with lawyers: “Don’t send lawyers. These lawyers don’t\r\nunderstand business; they don’t understand e-commerce.” The\r\nfollowing month, Alibaba stepped up its IP enforcement efforts by\r\nappointing Matthew J. Bassiur as head of Global Intellectual Property\r\nEnforcement. Bassiur had previously overseen anticounterfeiting\r\noperations at the pharmaceutical company Pfizer after several years\r\nwith Apple Computer. Prior to his corporate career, Bassiur served as\r\na federal prosecutor in the U.S. Department of Justice.\r\nFake goods weren’t the only issue weighing on Alibaba’s share\r\nprice after its IPO. Some investors fretted about fake trades, too. Also\r\nknown as “brushing,” fake trades involve merchants shipping empty\r\nboxes to ghost customers to boost their rankings.26 Local brands—\r\nparticularly those in highly competitive sectors like apparel,\r\ncosmetics, and electronics goods—are the main culprits. Rather than\r\ncarrying out the fake trades themselves, these merchants typically\r\nhire “click farming” companies to generate the fake purchases for\r\nthem. They can also hire the same click farms to generate fake,\r\npositive product reviews to influence real purchasers. By one\r\nestimate, four click farms27 interviewed each claim to control at least\r\nfive million Taobao buyer accounts. These firms no doubt exaggerate\r\ntheir influence—to boost their appeal to potential customers—but\r\ncollectively the click farm companies claim that in 2015 they\r\naccounted for double digit percentages of the total merchandise\r\nvolume of Singles’ Day purchases in 2015. Alibaba and other ecommerce\r\nplayers are on the lookout for these companies—\r\nmonitoring traffic and transaction patterns to root out suspicious\r\nactivity. (Although the click farms claim they can circumvent these\r\nattempts, they assent that these methods are not rigorously applied.)\r\nAs with the battle against fake goods, Alibaba and other e-commerce\r\nplayers are engaged in a cat-and-mouse game. Like piracy, brushing\r\ncannot be eliminated entirely, unless the algorithms that rank\r\nmerchants based on sales volume are abandoned. The e-commerce\r\nplayers can, and do, act to increase the costs of bad actors. Tmall’s\r\n“anti-brushing” systems monitor behavior to establish if a purchaser is\r\na real person, for example, by ensuring that the session involves\r\nclicks on a range of products—suggesting actual browsing of goods\r\non sale—and sufficient time spent on each web page, concluding with\r\na purchase deemed to be a reasonable amount for one person to\r\nmake. In response, the click farms have increased the sophistication\r\nof their service, charging as much as thirty yuan ($4.70) per faked\r\norder, compared to the typical range of ten to twenty yuan ($1.56–\r\n3.12) per order, depending on the costs involved, such as\r\ncommissions, payment fees, and generating fake logistics\r\ninformation. Tmall is more prone to brushing than Taobao, as the\r\ncompetition to secure high-ranking sales—and the publicity these can\r\ngenerate—in promotions like Singles’ Day is so intense.\r\nAlibaba’s e-commerce platforms have become so large that\r\npolicing the huge volume of goods and transactions is becoming ever\r\nmore complex. Yet this size is also Alibaba’s great strength.\r\nMerchants on Alibaba’s sites are increasingly willing to spend money\r\nto upgrade their stores. Even merchants who prefer to sell goods on\r\nother sites still keep a presence on Taobao because it means\r\nconsumers trust them more.\r\nCompetitors in the Wings\r\nNevertheless Alibaba is facing rising competition in a number of\r\ncategories like clothing,28 cosmetics,29 books,30 and food.31 To\r\nbuttress its position in electronics and electrical appliances, Alibaba\r\nhas even started to make investments in traditional retailers as part of\r\nthe new trend, mentioned earlier, called “omni-channel” or “online to\r\noffline,” abbreviated as “O2O.” In August 2015, Alibaba shelled out\r\nmore than $4.5 billion to buy a stake32 in Suning, an electronics and\r\nwhite goods retailer. But some analysts questioned the logic of buying\r\ninto a company with more than 1,600 stores across the country that,\r\nlike Best Buy in the United States, were at risk of becoming merely\r\nexpensive showrooms used by customers to try out products that\r\nthey would later buy online. Alibaba made the investment in Suning in\r\npart to counter its biggest competitor in e-commerce, a well-funded\r\ncompany called JD.com,33 which went public in the United States four\r\nmonths before Alibaba. JD is a threat to Alibaba in part because it\r\nrepresents a competition of ideas. Unlike Alibaba, JD is more closely\r\nmodeled on Amazon, purchasing and selling its own inventory. In\r\naddition, while Alibaba has kept one step removed, JD owns and\r\noperates its own logistics network. While Alibaba argues that JD will\r\nnever rival it in scale due to the costs of owning inventory and shifting\r\nphysical goods, JD counters that its model ensures a higher quality of\r\nproduct and speed of delivery to its customers.\r\nJD clearly riles Jack. In early 2015 he turned his guns on the\r\nfounder of JD, Richard Liu. Although he spoke the words to a friend in\r\nwhat he thought was confidence, Jack’s criticism of the company was\r\nposted on social media: “JD.com will eventually be a tragedy and this\r\nis a tragedy I have warned everyone about from day one. . . . So I’ve\r\ntold everyone in the company, don’t go near JD.com.” Soon after the\r\nincident, Jack apologized, joking, “The next time I have a\r\nconversation, it’ll be in a public bath.”\r\nThe Big Two\r\nAnother reason why Jack has trained his guns on JD is that it enjoys\r\nthe backing34 of Tencent, Alibaba’s main Internet rival. As Alibaba\r\nextends into new territory beyond e-commerce, it is increasingly\r\nbumping into Tencent, whose valuation in 2015 at times surpassed\r\nthat of Alibaba. Tencent makes most of its money in online games but\r\nis a threat to Alibaba because of the phenomenal success of\r\nWeChat,35 the mobile application it launched in 2011 that has\r\namassed more than 650 million regular users. WeChat is the primary\r\nmobile messaging platform in China, benefiting from—and even\r\ndriving—China’s smartphone boom. WeChat has been described36\r\nas “one app to rule them all.” Without WeChat a cell phone in China\r\nloses much of its utility. The WeChat app effectively has made the\r\ncontact book redundant. Most users check the application at least ten\r\ntimes a day. But WeChat is about far more than chat. Chinese\r\nconsumers use it37 for a much wider range of services than their\r\npeers in the West (who use Apple’s iMessage, Facebook’s\r\nMessenger, or WhatsApp). The power of Tencent’s ability to innovate\r\nwas demonstrated most dramatically in 2014 with WeChat’s Lunar\r\nNew Year “red packet” (hong bao) campaign. In just two days,\r\nWeChat users sent out more than 20 million virtual envelopes38 of\r\ncash. Jack even compared the psychological impact of WeChat’s\r\ncampaign on Alibaba to Pearl Harbor. Alibaba fought back in 2015\r\nbut despite doling out $100 million in cash-and-coupon promotions, it\r\nwas able to rack up only a quarter of the red packets sent by WeChat\r\nusers.\r\nWeChat exposed a critical gap in Alibaba’s armory that it tried to\r\nclose with its own mobile social app, Laiwang. Throwing everything it\r\ncould at promoting Laiwang, Alibaba even required every employee\r\nto sign up one hundred users in order to qualify for their annual\r\nbonus. But Laiwang launched two years after WeChat. By then it had\r\nalready lost the battle. Today even Alibaba’s senior executives use\r\nWeChat, resorting to Laiwang only for official communications with\r\ncolleagues.\r\nAlibaba is spending billions of dollars on investments,\r\nacquisitions, and marketing to shore up its mobile strategy, from\r\ninvesting in its YunOS,39 to buying stakes in Sina Weibo,40 the\r\nTwitter-like service, and Meizu, a smartphone manufacturer, to\r\nacquiring UCWeb, China’s leading mobile browser company,41 and\r\nAutoNavi, a leading online mapping company to boost Alibaba’s\r\nposition in location-based services. Alibaba has already shifted a lot\r\nof its core business to mobile. Half of all purchases made on\r\nAlibaba’s websites are made on mobile devices. But Alipay, the\r\nleading online payment provider in China, is Alibaba’s most important\r\nasset in its rivalry with Tencent to tackle the next frontier: the mobile\r\nwallet.\r\nControl the wallet, the thinking goes, and you control the\r\nbattlefield for a vast array of new opportunities beyond e-commerce,\r\nwith financial services being the most lucrative. Alibaba’s runaway\r\nsuccess with the Yu’e Bao (meaning “leftover treasure”) mutual fund\r\nis one example. But online banking is another. Alibaba is actively\r\npushing MYbank. Tencent is responding with WeBank, which has\r\nalready started to issue consumer loans42 within fifteen minutes to\r\nindividuals over their mobile phones, in amounts ranging from twenty\r\nthousand to three hundred thousand yuan (from $3,100 to $31,000).\r\nOther fronts are also opening up in the Alibaba versus Tencent\r\nconflict, including proxy wars between firms backed by the two\r\ncompanies. In 2014, the contest over Uber-like ride-booking apps\r\nbecame what one analyst described as “the first battle in the world\r\nwar of the Internet.” Alibaba backed a company called Kuaidi\r\nDache43 while Tencent backed its rival, Didi Dache44 in a conflict that\r\nraged out of control with $300 million poured in to fund tips and\r\nmarketing subsidies. The battle became so intense that Kuaidi even\r\noffered taxi drivers a free case of beer for referring fellow drivers. As\r\nthe red ink flowed on both sides, a truce was called in early 2015\r\nwhen the two transportation companies merged in a $6 billion\r\ntransaction to form Didi Kuaidi, although they retained the two\r\nseparate operating units. With a $16 billion valuation and $3 billion in\r\nnew capital, the new entity took on Uber, which had thrown its lot in\r\nwith Baidu.45 The “taxi wars” have even taken on international\r\nproportions, as Alibaba, Tencent, and Didi Kuadi have all invested in\r\nLyft, Uber’s principal U.S.-based competitor.\r\nIn 2015, Alibaba and Tencent also decided to combine two other\r\nproxies, Groupon-style companies Meituan and Dianping, in a $15\r\nbillion merger that some saw as also directed at Baidu and Nuomi, its\r\nproxy. Baidu also lacks a meaningful presence in payment, in\r\ncontrast with the dominance of Alipay and Tenpay.\r\nAlibaba and Tencent are so powerful today that the talk of the\r\n“Big Three” (with Baidu) is beginning to shift to talk of a “Big Two.” But\r\nif the trend of Alibaba and Tencent combining forces to create\r\ndominant proxies continues, there is a risk that consumers would be\r\nalarmed if subsidies are withdrawn or fees increased for popular\r\nservices like booking rides or ordering food, prompting intervention by\r\nthe Chinese government to restrict their market power.\r\nNo doubt mindful of the risks, since the SAIC incident, Alibaba\r\nappears to be trimming its sails ever closer to the prevailing\r\ngovernment winds. In September 2015, Alibaba elevated its Beijing\r\noffice to become its “second headquarters” along with Hangzhou. The\r\nsymbolism of a powerful company in southern China announcing a\r\nnew “coheadquarters” in Beijing is obvious, although the city is much\r\nmore than just a political center—it is an essential business hub as\r\nwell.46 There are also practical reasons for the move. Alibaba\r\ndescribes adding Beijing to Hangzhou as its “twin hub” a strategy to\r\nsharpen its edge in northern provinces in the face of increasing\r\ncompetition: By the end of 2015, JD.com had surpassed Tmall by\r\nsome estimates to become the leading e-commerce player in Beijing.\r\nUpgrading its office in Beijing is important for recruitment, too.\r\nAlready home to over nine thousand employees, Beijing has a deeper\r\npool of prospective talent for the company to draw on. The capital is\r\nhome to some of the country’s most prestigious universities and\r\nabout one million students. In the competition for top talent, offering\r\nthe ability to work in Beijing reduces the risk of losing candidates who\r\nprefer not to move to Hangzhou,47 which by comparison is a much\r\nsmaller, provincial city.\r\nYet on Singles’ Day 2015, there were signs, too, that Alibaba is\r\nstepping up its efforts to cultivate government support. Hours before\r\nthe launch of Singles’ Day, Alibaba reported that Chinese Premier Li\r\nKeqiang’s office had contacted Jack “congratulating and encouraging\r\nthe creation and achievement of the 11/11 event.” As the day began\r\ninside the Water Cube, the upper-right section of the screen that was\r\nrecording transactions on Tmall was reserved for a map and a data\r\nfeed displaying the purchases in countries like Belarus and\r\nKazakhstan, two of sixty-four countries and regions along the “One\r\nBelt, One Road” (OBOR48), also known as the “Belt and Road”\r\ninitiative, a centerpiece of President Xi Jinping’s foreign and\r\neconomic policy.\r\nWhatever the risks, Jack professes confidence in Alibaba’s\r\nfuture. While the government can play a role in stimulating exports\r\nand boosting investment in the economy, he stated, “Consumption is\r\nnot done by government—it’s done by entrepreneurship and the\r\nmarket economy. So, we have a great opportunity. Now it’s our turn,\r\nnot the government’s turn.”\r\nAlibaba is going all out to grab the opportunity available to the\r\nprivate sector. In recent years, Alibaba’s deal making has been so\r\nfrenzied that one journalist friend in Beijing complained to me that he\r\nhad little time to cover anyone else and had spent many an evening\r\nor weekend writing up the company’s latest conquest. Covering\r\nAlibaba is complicated because the deals often involve a web of\r\nrelationships, including those linked to Jack’s own private equity fund,\r\nYunfeng Capital.\r\nYunfeng: Billionaire’s Boys Club\r\nYunfeng is a private equity company in which Jack holds an\r\napproximate 40 percent stake and serves as a partner.49 Yunfeng50\r\nwas launched in 2010 by Jack and cofounder David Yu51 and\r\nothers.52 It is a sort of “billionaire’s boys club,” something that the\r\nfund promotes as a core strength, calling itself the “only private equity\r\nfund launched by successful entrepreneurs and industry luminaries.”\r\nTo those who criticize deal making between Alibaba and Yunfeng,\r\nYunfeng is at pains to point out that Jack plays no role in the\r\ninvestment decisions of its various funds. Alibaba emphasizes that\r\nJack will forgo any gains made from his involvement in Yunfeng.\r\nThe fact that most of the billionaires involved in Yunfeng have\r\nroots in Zhejiang or Shanghai is instructive. Just like the “cluster\r\ncities” in Alibaba’s home turf, these entrepreneurs have a deepseated\r\ntendency to club together. Now “investment clusters” are\r\nemerging in China’s New Economy, too, with Alibaba the most\r\nprominent of all. The company can make the case that when buying\r\nYunfeng-invested companies53 Alibaba is investing in companies that\r\nJack already knows, making the fund a form of advance due\r\ndiligence.\r\nYet each new deal struck between Alibaba and Yunfeng-related\r\ncompanies introduces further complexity,54 potentially obscuring the\r\ntrue nature of Alibaba’s relationships with the outside business world.\r\nIs this the way Alibaba will maintain its competitive edge and\r\ninnovative capacity? If transactions between Alibaba and Yunfenginvested\r\ncompanies are not carefully explained, and the valuations\r\nclearly justified, public investors in Alibaba might not be fully aware of\r\nthe hidden risks involved. This concern, amid some indications of\r\ntension between Yunfeng and Alibaba’s in-house M&A team,\r\nappeared to have prompted Jack to relinquish his role as an\r\nexecutive55 in Yunfeng, maintaining only a passive interest as an\r\ninvestor56 in the fund.\r\nDuring its IPO road show Alibaba emphasized three central\r\ngrowth drivers for the future: cloud computing/Big Data; expansion\r\ninto rural markets; and globalization/cross-border trade.\r\nThree Core Drivers\r\nCloud computing is an obvious direction for Alibaba. Investors in\r\nAmazon value highly the “virtual” revenue streams of its Amazon Web\r\nServices business. Although for Alibaba cloud services represent only\r\n3 percent of revenues today, it is investing over $1 billion to expand\r\nthem. Alibaba also talks often about the shift from the information\r\ntechnology era to a data technology era, “from IT to DT.” Alibaba\r\nlooks to “DT” to help toward another favorite buzzword for the\r\ncompany: “C2B,” or “consumer-to-business.” This is the idea that DT,\r\nincluding Big Data, can help Chinese manufacturers improve\r\ncommunication throughout the supply chain to predict demand,\r\npotentially eliminating inventory. By exploiting the information flowing\r\nacross Alibaba’s e-commerce, logistics, and finance businesses—for\r\nexample predicting consumer trends and investment opportunities—\r\nthe company hopes to leverage the “iron triangle” to even greater\r\neffect. Aliyun, Alibaba’s cloud computing business, operates data\r\ncenters in Beijing, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and\r\nSilicon Valley as well as a newly established international hub in\r\nSingapore. The company plans, according to its president, Simon Hu,\r\n“to overtake Amazon in four years, whether in terms of customers,\r\ntechnology, or worldwide scale.”\r\nIn rural markets, Alibaba hopes to unlock new tiers of consumers\r\nand merchants. China is home to more than 700 million rural\r\nresidents, but only one-quarter are online. As Internet and mobile\r\npenetration increases, Alibaba is opening up kiosk-like service\r\ncenters in rural areas, committing over $1.6 billion to the effort.\r\nThe first pilot county project for Alibaba’s “Rural Taobao” initiative\r\nis Tonglu, the same county where Jack’s U.S. adventure began, and\r\nthe birthplace of the country’s major private courier companies.\r\nAlibaba’s own research arm, AliResearch, predicts that rural online\r\nshopping will reach 460 billion yuan ($72 billion) by the end of 2016.\r\nCracking this market is not easy, since it’s complicated by poor\r\nlogistics and the lower levels of education of rural residents.\r\nFormer Alibaba.com CEO David Wei believes that for the group\r\nto “go rural” is more critical than for it to “go global.” “If they don’t get\r\ninto India, Alibaba is still Alibaba. But if they miss the countryside in\r\nChina, home to six hundred to seven hundred million people, then\r\nanother Alibaba could emerge.” Alibaba’s rival JD.com has launched\r\nits own rural initiative—“Wildfire of a Thousand Counties”—and its\r\ncore products such as washing machines and refrigerators are\r\namong the most craved items by countryside dwellers.\r\nIn any case, Alibaba has little choice but to “go rural.” China’s\r\nState Council has unveiled a major new initiative to promote ecommerce\r\nin the countryside—echoed by Premier Li Keqiang’s\r\n“Internet +” vision—and after the SAIC debacle, Alibaba can’t afford\r\nto be seen as unsupportive. In July 2015, Jack led a delegation of\r\nAlibaba executives to Yan’an in Shaanxi Province. This rural location\r\nhas tremendous significance in China as it lies near the end of the\r\nroute of the Long March,57 and served as a key base from 1936 to\r\n1948 for the Communist Revolution. Jack’s delegation included over\r\nthirty senior Alibaba executives including Polo Shao (Shao Xiaofeng),\r\na former criminal investigator who is senior vice president and\r\ndirector for the Office of the Chairman at Alibaba Group and is also\r\nbelieved to serve as secretary of the Communist Party committee of\r\nthe company.\r\nIn discussions with local Communist Party secretary and\r\ngovernment officials, the delegation explored ways Alibaba could help\r\npromote economic development in the area, from establishing data\r\ncenters to offering loans to local entrepreneurs to promoting the sale\r\nof locally grown apples. But Jack also used the visit to attend a\r\nlecture given by local Communist Party officials, after which he said\r\nthat he just wanted to “come and take a look. The conditions were\r\nextremely hard in Yan’an at that time,” and that he was keen to learn\r\nhow “the Communist Party could stick to revolution romanticism and\r\nrevolution heroism under such conditions.”\r\nSuch speeches are of little help in promoting the third of\r\nAlibaba’s core drivers, expanding in overseas markets. Yet in doing\r\nso Alibaba is also in step with the Chinese government’s call to “go\r\nglobal,” encouraging Chinese companies to go beyond simply\r\nexporting to extending their operations and influence overseas. This\r\nis nothing new for Alibaba, a company that started out with an\r\ninternational orientation in 1999. But with the success of Taobao\r\nstarting a decade ago, Alibaba’s focus turned inward. In 2010, the\r\nprofile of international markets started to increase again with the\r\nlaunch of AliExpress, connecting sellers in China with consumers\r\noverseas. At first Alibaba expected the United States to be\r\nAliExpress’s key market. But Alibaba discovered that America was a\r\nmarket with sophisticated players, both online and offline. After the\r\nearly disappointments, then-Alibaba.com CEO David Wei instructed\r\nhis team to look at countries with the lowest efficiency in their retail\r\nsector.\r\nJack Magic comes to 10 Downing Street. Jack (left) regales a crowd, including British prime\r\nminister David Cameron (second from left) and the author at a reception at 10 Downing\r\nStreet in London on October 19, 2015, shortly after Jack was named a member of the UK’s\r\nBusiness Advisory Group. 10 Downing Street\r\nWithout AliExpress even opening offices there, but with Russian\r\nand Portuguese language capabilities added to the AliExpress\r\nwebsite, Russia and Brazil became early success stories. Demand\r\nfrom Alibaba’s customers in Brazil at one point exceeded over three\r\nhundred thousand packages a day, before a slowing economy and\r\nthe weakening real hit the company’s business there. Demand in\r\nRussia, especially for clothing and consumer electronics, was so\r\nstrong that AliExpress reportedly even broke the Russian postal\r\nservice, leading to the dismissal of its boss. Today Russia accounts\r\nfor a fifth of AliExpress’s sales.\r\nIn 2015, Alibaba appointed former top Goldman Sachs executive\r\nJ. Michael Evans as its new president, charged with leading\r\ninternational development efforts. These include its growing presence\r\nin Western Europe, where Alibaba aims to entice brands to target\r\nChinese consumers through its websites.58 At an event hosted in\r\nOctober 2015 by British prime minister David Cameron at 10\r\nDowning Street in London, Jack was named as one of Cameron’s\r\nbusiness advisers.\r\nAlibaba announced it was upgrading its office in the city to\r\nbecome its European headquarters, headed by Amee Chande, a\r\nformer Walmart executive. Alibaba is also opening a network of\r\n“business embassies” in France, Germany, and Italy. Paris is headed\r\nby Sébastien Badault, formerly of Amazon and Google; Milan is\r\nheaded by Rodrigo Cipriani Foresio, who previously worked at Buon\r\nItalia, an online food store; and Munich is headed by Terry von Bibra,\r\na former executive with leading German retailer Karstadt. Alibaba’s\r\ngrowing presence in Europe brings it closer to the headquarters of\r\nmany of the brands most coveted by Chinese consumers. Any\r\nsuccess stories it can generate—bringing European brands to the\r\nfast-growing consumer market in China—will no doubt also be an\r\nopportunity to strengthen its hand with its most vociferous critics, like\r\nKering, the parent company of Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci.\r\nThe United States is also a key market for Alibaba’s overseas\r\nefforts, mostly as the focus of its international investments. Alibaba\r\nhas poured hundreds of millions of dollars into high-profile companies\r\nsuch as Lyft, Snapchat, Zulily, and a range of smaller players.59 But\r\nthese investments are more focused on absorbing new technologies\r\nor know-how to be deployed in China than they are a concerted effort\r\nto break into the U.S. market. The one Alibaba effort that did explicitly\r\ntarget the U.S. market, 11Main.com, was a conspicuous failure.60\r\nSpeculation by some analysts that Alibaba would make a bold move\r\nin America, including an acquisition of eBay or Yahoo, has so far\r\nproved off the mark. Instead Alibaba’s emphasis remains firmly on\r\ndeveloping cross-border trade.\r\nAlibaba has been actively ramping up its own presence in the\r\nStates, setting up a string of four offices along the length of the West\r\nCoast: an office just off Market Street in San Francisco, which houses\r\nAlibaba’s international corporate communications team, headed by\r\nformer PepsiCo executive Jim Wilkinson;61 a new Alibaba Group\r\noffice in San Mateo, California, where Michael Evans is based; an\r\noffice in Pasadena, California, which serves as the U.S. home of\r\nAlibaba Pictures; and a small presence in downtown Seattle, just one\r\nblock away from the U.S. Bank building, where Jack first logged on to\r\nthe Internet back in 1995. In 2016 Alibaba is rolling out new offices in\r\nNew York City, bringer it closer to U.S. brands, retailers, and\r\nadvertisers, as well as in Washington, D.C., beefing up its lobbying\r\nand communications capacity, headed by Eric Pelletier, former GE\r\nexecutive and White House staff member.62\r\nDespite its growing physical presence in the country, during a\r\nvisit to New York and Chicago in the summer of 2015, Jack dismissed\r\ntalk of any “Alibaba invasion” of America. He said he was often\r\nasked, “‘When are you coming to invade America? When are you\r\ngoing to compete with Amazon? When are you going to compete with\r\neBay?’ Well, I would say, we show great respect for eBay and\r\nAmazon, but I think the opportunity and the strategy for us is helping\r\nsmall business in America go to China, sell their products to China.”\r\nOn that same trip to the United States, Jack also discussed the\r\nstrain of running a public company. He complained that his life after\r\nthe IPO was more difficult than before, and that “[i]f I had another life,\r\nI would keep my company private.” Some in the audience in New\r\nYork expressed surprise that Jack would voice regrets about listing so\r\nsoon after Alibaba’s blockbuster IPO. But this contrarian stance is\r\nvintage Jack.\r\nFrom Philosopher to Philanthropist\r\nJack already has a reputation as China’s philosopher CEO, and\r\nincreasingly he is seen as a philanthropist and environmentalist, too.\r\nSix months ahead of the 2014 IPO, Jack and Joe together pledged 2\r\npercent of Alibaba Group—from their personal holdings—to create a\r\nnew Alibaba philanthropic trust.63 The pledge was made in the form\r\nof stock options with an exercise price of $25 (some $43 below the\r\ninitial offering price), creating overnight what became one of the\r\nlargest philanthropic organizations in China. Jack also committed to\r\nendow the trust with more of his personal fortune in the future.64\r\nThe trust will focus primarily on China’s environment and health\r\ncare—two issues about which Jack has become increasingly vocal in\r\nrecent years. China’s rapid industrialization and urbanization have\r\nwrought havoc on the country’s environment and people’s health. At a\r\nconference for entrepreneurs in 2013,65 Jack delivered a call to arms,\r\nhis message distilled in an article later published by the Harvard\r\nBusiness Review: “Cancer—a rare word in conversation thirty years\r\nago—is now an everyday topic.” Jack often talks of the growing\r\nincidence of cancer among his employees, friends, and their\r\nfamilies,66 including in his Q&A session with President Obama.\r\n“Without a healthy environment on this earth, no matter how much\r\nmoney you make, no matter how wonderful you are, you will have a\r\nbad disaster.”\r\nWith his activism, and the symbolism of the lake he built on the\r\nWetlands headquarter campus, Jack is demonstrating that\r\n“[s]omebody has to do something. . . . Our job is to wake people up.”\r\nJack isn’t shy about criticizing the old industrial model: “Chinese\r\npeople used to feel a sense of pride for being the world’s factory. Now\r\neveryone realizes what it costs to be that factory. Our water has\r\nbecome undrinkable, our food inedible, our milk poisonous, and worst\r\nof all, the air in our cities is so polluted that we often cannot see the\r\nsun.” In his article, Jack also took aim at the government’s inaction\r\ntoward the environmental crisis: “Before, no matter how hard we\r\nappealed to the privileged and the powerful for attention on water, air,\r\nand food security issues, nobody wanted to listen. The privileged still\r\ngot their privileged water and privileged food.67 But everyone\r\nbreathes the same air. It doesn’t matter how wealthy or powerful you\r\nare, if you can’t enjoy the sunshine, you can’t be truly happy.” Like\r\nmany of the other superrich in China, Jack bought himself a pristine\r\npatch of paradise abroad. In 2015, with the help of the Nature\r\nConservancy, an environmental foundation founded by a former\r\nGoldman Sachs banker, Jack purchased the $23 million Brandon\r\nPark estate in New York State’s Adirondack Mountains; the estate is\r\npart of a holding that once belonged to the Rockefeller family. In his\r\ninterview with Jack at APEC in Manila in November 2015, President\r\nObama hailed Jack for taking an interest in the environment: “I know\r\nthat in addition to the work that you have been doing with nonprofits\r\nrecently, you have also been in conversations with Bill Gates about\r\nthe potential of really turbo-charging investment in research and\r\ndevelopment around clean energy.” Shortly afterward, on the eve of\r\nCOP21, the UN conference on climate change in Paris, Jack\r\nannounced his support for the “Breakthrough Energy Coalition.” Led\r\nby Bill Gates, Jack was joined by his investor Masayoshi Son and\r\nformer sparring partner Meg Whitman, along with Mark Zuckerberg\r\nand Jeff Bezos, among the twenty-eight investors pledging to help\r\nfund research into new technologies to reduce carbon emissions.\r\nHealth and Happiness\r\nJack’s focus on the environment and people’s health goes beyond a\r\nsense of corporate responsibility: Alibaba has business aspirations,\r\ntoo. In 2014 the company invested in CITIC 21CN, a Hong Kong–\r\nlisted, pharmaceutical data business. As it has since been renamed,\r\nAlibaba Health seeks to profit from the inefficiencies of state-owned\r\nproviders in the sector, including making appointment bookings easier\r\nfor patients, as well as making it easier for doctors, clinics, and\r\nconsumers to access information about and to order\r\npharmaceuticals. The focus on health care is one of two long-term\r\ninvestment areas that Jack summarizes as the “2 H’s”: health and\r\nhappiness.68\r\nIn addition to making people healthier, he aims to make “young\r\npeople enjoy their lives, to be optimistic in the future. All the heroes in\r\nChinese movies die. In American movies, all the heroes survive. I ask\r\npeople, ‘If all the heroes die, who wants to be a hero?’” Why the\r\ninterest, for an e-commerce company, in entertainment?\r\nTrue to his roots as a teacher, Jack often talks about taking care\r\nof the needs of the younger generation. In an interview with Charlie\r\nRose he shared his view that, in China, “lots of young people lose\r\nhope, lose vision, and start to complain.” Alibaba is increasingly\r\nactive in areas that Jack hopes could provide the answer: sports and\r\nentertainment.\r\nIn November 2015, Alibaba sponsored the first regular-season\r\nU.S. college Pac-12 Conference basketball game in Shanghai,\r\nbetween the University of Washington Huskies and the University of\r\nTexas Longhorns, and announced it would host a game between\r\nStanford and Harvard universities a year later. Alibaba has also\r\nstarted to buy sports teams. In June 2014, he made a $200 million\r\ninvestment in the Guangzhou Evergrande soccer team, a deal\r\nnegotiated, the team’s owner69 later revealed, while Jack was drunk.\r\nJack justified the investment: “I think not understanding soccer\r\ndoesn’t matter. . . . I also didn’t understand retail, e-commerce, or the\r\nInternet, but that didn’t stop me from doing it anyway.” He said he\r\nwas not investing in soccer, he was “investing in entertainment.”\r\nAlibaba is one of China’s leading investors in film, television, and\r\nonline video. The company’s biggest outlay in traditional media so far\r\nis its $800 million investment in a Hong Kong–based film and TV\r\nstudio70 that it rebranded Alibaba Pictures. In 2014 Alibaba tapped\r\nZhang Qiang, then vice president of the powerful, state-owned\r\ndistributor China Film Group, to head up its entertainment business in\r\nChina. Alibaba is also jointly invested71 with Tencent in Huayi\r\nBrothers, a Beijing-based film and TV studio and acquired cinema\r\nticketing company Yulekei. But Alibaba has made its biggest splash in\r\nInternet-based media, including investing in and then72 acquiring\r\nYouku Tudou, a company founded by former Sohu executive Victor\r\nKoo.73 More than 430 million people in China regularly watch videos\r\nonline, mostly on their mobile devices, with some shows reaching\r\nlarger audiences than the country’s state-owned terrestrial\r\nbroadcasters. The market used to be rife with pirated content, but\r\ntoday major online video platforms like Youku are pushing hard to\r\nbecome the local equivalent of Netflix, featuring programs such as\r\npopular Korean dramas or hit shows from the United States like 2\r\nBroke Girls. The $4 billion online video market—generated mostly by\r\nadvertising, but also some subscription revenue—is still a challenging\r\nplace to make money given the cost of licensing content. Youku\r\nTudou never made a profit. Some investors questioned the impact of\r\nthe acquisition on Alibaba’s cost structure, but Alibaba justifies it to\r\ncompete with rival platforms from Tencent, Baidu, and others. Also\r\nAlibaba had already announced plans to launch its own streaming\r\nservice, “Tmall Box Office,” or “TBO,” in conjunction with cable TV\r\nplayer Wasu Media, in which Jack had already invested personally.\r\nThe idea behind TBO is to be as disruptive a player on TV production\r\nin China as Netflix is in the United States. Already close to half a\r\nbillion people74 watch videos online on sites controlled by Alibaba,\r\nBaidu, Tencent, and others. Yet in another sign of the limits imposed\r\non entrepreneurs when they encroach on its turf, in November 2015,\r\nthe government imposed new restrictions on the amount of imported\r\ncontent—previously capped at 30 percent—they can offer on their\r\nplatforms. In an effort to promote more homegrown content, Alibaba\r\nis also looking to explore new ways to finance shows, including\r\nharnessing crowdfunding through a company it acquired called\r\nYulebao.\r\nWith its newly established U.S. base in Pasadena, California,\r\nAlibaba Pictures has big ambitions. Jack has said that he wants\r\nnothing less than to make Alibaba “the biggest entertainment\r\ncompany in the world.” Leading the charge for Alibaba’s overseas\r\ninvestments in entertainment is Zhang Wei, appointed in 2015 as\r\npresident of Alibaba Pictures. An alumna of Harvard Business\r\nSchool, Zhang once hosted a business show on China Central\r\nTelevision (CCTV) and worked as a media executive with CNBC and\r\nStar Television before joining Alibaba in 2008. Alibaba Pictures has\r\nyet to release its own film but it has already financed movies like\r\nMission: Impossible—Rogue Nation. In an interview with The\r\nHollywood Reporter, Zhang revealed the initial resistance from\r\nstudios to working with Alibaba: “The first thing everyone wonders is\r\nwhat an e-commerce company can actually do for them. One of the\r\nbiggest disconnects the studios face is that they never really know, in\r\na detailed, comprehensive way, who is coming to see their movies.\r\nEven the filmmakers would probably like to know this. How old are\r\nthey? Where are they from? Do they have kids? What are their other\r\ninterests? What’s their living situation? What type of people are they?\r\nWe talk about demand-driven entertainment. Bringing the Internet\r\ndeeper into the entertainment business is the best way to solve that\r\npuzzle.” Zhang added that Alibaba can utilize Alipay, used by many\r\npeople to buy cinema tickets online, to gain a greater understanding\r\nof moviegoers: “The movie audience is much younger in China, as\r\ngoing to the movies is a lifestyle change. The generation before went\r\nto karaoke. Now they go to the movies as a primary source of\r\nentertainment.”\r\nMore tangibly, merchandising is an area that ties together ecommerce\r\nand entertainment. Zhang explains, “In the U.S., theatrical\r\nmakes up maybe 30 to 40 percent of revenue. In China, theatrical is\r\nthe majority by far. There’s so much value that has not been\r\ndeveloped yet in the merchandising space.” Zhang points to the\r\nMission: Impossible tie-ins as an example, selecting qualified\r\nmerchants to manufacture licensed goods: “We came up with about\r\nthirty products with Paramount’s merchandising team, sending them\r\ndesigns and samples throughout the whole process. We showed\r\nmany directly to Tom Cruise as well, to make sure he was OK with\r\nhow they represented the Mission: Impossible brand. This is our\r\nvalue: connecting both parties. In the past, how does a backpack\r\nmaker in Zhejiang Province connect with Paramount and Tom Cruise\r\nin such an efficient and reliable way? It was just impossible.”\r\nInevitably, given Jack’s big plans in entertainment, Jack has been\r\nasked whether Alibaba intends to buy a Hollywood studio. Viacom’s\r\nParamount Pictures is one rumored target, which as the studio\r\nbehind Forrest Gump might give Jack just the perch—or bench—that\r\nhe craves in Hollywood. So far Alibaba has denied its intentions to\r\nbuy a studio outright: “Well, I don’t think they want to sell. It’s better\r\nwe partner. You can never buy everything in the world.”\r\nYet barely a day goes by when Alibaba, or Jack himself, is not\r\nlisted as a potential buyer of a company, somewhere in the world. In\r\nDecember 2015, Alibaba confirmed it was purchasing the South\r\nChina Morning Post (SCMP), the main English daily newspaper in\r\nHong Kong. Some saw the purchase of the 112-year-old publication\r\nas a means for Jack to burnish his credentials as a mogul. After all,\r\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos had personally acquired the Washington\r\nPost two years earlier. Was Jack simply following suit?\r\nOthers saw signs of something deeper: that Jack was buying the\r\npaper to curry favor with Beijing. Almost two decades after the United\r\nKingdom handed back the territory in 1997, the Chinese government\r\nis grappling with a yawning political and social divide75 in Hong Kong.\r\nIn 2014 the territory was brought to a standstill by the Occupy Central\r\nmovement (also known as the Umbrella Revolution), a student-led\r\nmovement protesting a lack of democracy and other freedoms.\r\nAlthough the crisis ended peacefully, the underlying tensions that\r\nfueled it remain ever present. The SCMP had reported extensively on\r\nthe protests. Critics speculated that Jack had offered his services to\r\nbring the paper to heel—or even that he had no choice but to comply\r\nwith a directive from Beijing to do so.\r\nJack dismissed the conspiracy theories: “I have always\r\nencountered speculation from other people. If I had to bother about\r\nwhat other people speculated about, how would I get anything done?”\r\nHe vowed to respect the editorial independence of the newspaper:\r\n“They have an independent platform and they can have their own\r\nbeliefs.”\r\nFor the newspaper, the backing of a well-funded and influential\r\nbusiness group on the mainland has obvious attractions. Like many\r\nprint publications, the subscription-based business model of the\r\nSCMP, although still profitable, has suffered in the face of free online\r\ncontent. In line with Alibaba’s longtime commitment to offer services\r\nfor free, Alibaba will remove the newspaper’s subscription paywall,\r\nallowing wider distribution and unlocking new business opportunities.\r\nIn a Q&A with the newspaper, executive vice chairman Joe Tsai\r\nexplained, “Our vision for SCMP is to build a global readership. . . .\r\nEven though some say the newspaper industry is a sunset industry,\r\nwe don’t see it that way. We see it as an opportunity to use our\r\ntechnological expertise, and use our digital assets and know-how to\r\ndistribute news in a way that has never been done before.” In\r\nbusiness terms, the downside for the purchase is relatively limited,\r\nand a turnaround could win Jack plaudits.\r\nFor Alibaba, the deal is not large in terms of money: They paid\r\njust over $200 million for the business. Yet given the intense scrutiny\r\nthat it invites, the transaction is not without risks. In his Q&A Joe\r\nexplained that if the SCMP can help the world understand China\r\nbetter, this will also be good for Alibaba—a company based in China\r\nbut listed in the United States: “China is important; China is a rising\r\neconomy. It is the second-largest economy in the world. People\r\nshould learn more about China.” Yet in comments that both revealed\r\nhis frustration and emboldened those critical of the deal, he added,\r\n“The coverage about China should be balanced and fair. Today when\r\nI see mainstream Western news organizations cover China, they\r\ncover it through a very particular lens. It is through the lens that China\r\nis a communist state and everything kind of follows from that. A lot of\r\njournalists working with these Western media organizations may not\r\nagree with the system of governance in China and that taints their\r\nview of coverage. We see things differently; we believe things should\r\nbe presented as they are. Present facts, tell the truth, and that is the\r\nprinciple that we are going to operate on.”\r\nWhatever Jack’s motivations for the acquisition are, by becoming\r\na newspaper proprietor in Hong Kong he is wading into deeper\r\nwaters. Yet he has never shied away from challenges before. Jack’s\r\nfame stems from the story of how a Chinese company somehow got\r\nthe better of Silicon Valley, an East beats West tale worthy of a Jin\r\nYong novel. His continued success, though, is becoming a story of\r\nSouth versus North—of a company with roots in the entrepreneurial\r\nheartland of southern China testing the limits imposed by the\r\ncountry’s political masters in Beijing.\r\nSince Xi Jinping became president of China in 2012, high-profile\r\nentrepreneurs have found themselves increasingly subject to scrutiny\r\nand sanction from the Chinese government. One high-profile real\r\nestate entrepreneur, Vantone Holdings’s Feng Lun, even blogged—\r\nthen later deleted—the following message: “A private tycoon once\r\nsaid, ‘In the eyes of a government official, we are nothing but\r\ncockroaches. If he wants to kill you, he kills you. If he wants to let you\r\nlive, he lets you live.’” The temporary and still unexplained\r\ndisappearance in December 2015 of Fosun chairman Guo\r\nGuangchang—once feted as a “Warren Buffet of China”—further\r\nillustrates those risks.\r\nJack is already the standard-bearer for China’s consumer and\r\nentrepreneurial revolution. Now he is advancing on new fronts, such\r\nas finance and the media, that have long been dominated by the\r\nstate.\r\nForged in the entrepreneurial crucible of Zhejiang and fueled by\r\nhis faith in the transformative power of the Internet, Jack is the\r\nultimate pragmatist. By demonstrating the power of technology to\r\nassist a government confronted with the rising expectations of its\r\npeople for a better life—from the environment, education, and health\r\ncare to continued access to economic opportunity—Jack aims to\r\ncreate the space for him to fulfill even greater ambitions.\r\nOne leading Chinese Internet entrepreneur put it to me like this:\r\n“Most people think of Alibaba as a story. It’s not just a story, it’s a\r\nstrategy.”\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nFor my father, David Clark, and my partner, Robin Wang.\r\nI am deeply grateful for the inspiration, encouragement, and\r\nfriendship of Amy Tan, Lou DeMattei, and the whole team at\r\nTandema.\r\nI would like especially to thank Mei Yan, for her friendship and for\r\nworking so tirelessly on this project throughout, and my former\r\ncollaborators at Stanford University: Marguerite Gong Hancock, for\r\nencouraging me to write this book, and Professor Bill Miller, for his\r\ninsights into what makes Silicon Valley tick.\r\nMany thanks to our research assistant Chang Yu at Peking\r\nUniversity, now completing her Ph.D. in Hong Kong for which I wish\r\nher the best of luck.\r\nAt BDA, Meiqin Fang was very generous with her time and\r\nguidance, along with Dawson Zhang.

Behind the United States, Japan, Germany, and the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n15. eBay took two seats on EachNet’s board. Bo held one of the\r\nother three.\r\n16. The contrast between eBay’s travails in China, where it had\r\nmade an outright acquisition, and its triumph in Latin America,\r\nwhere it had made a minority investment in 2001 in local player\r\nMercado Libre, would speak for itself. Today Mercado Libre is the\r\nmost successful commerce player in Latin America, worth more\r\nthan $6 billion, and eBay owns over 18 percent.\r\n17. Initially through a joint venture with Alibaba in which SoftBank\r\ninvested $50 million, with the additional investment in the form of\r\n$30 million in convertible notes that they could later convert into\r\nordinary shares.\r\n18. Shou Yuan.\r\n19. “Taobao” was not the first choice of name for the new business.\r\nThe original name was “Alimama,” subsequently used for the\r\ncompany’s online marketing technology platform.\r\n20. Toto Sun was known as “the God of Wealth” (or “Cai Shen” in\r\nChinese). His staff liked to call him “Uncle of Wealth.” Sun hoped\r\nthat the nickname would bring good luck to this new addition to\r\nthe Alibaba family. Zhang Yu, a vice president in charge of\r\noperations, was known as Yu Yan, one of the leading female\r\nroles in Jin Yong’s novel Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils.\r\n21. For the impact of her regular publication The Internet Report, first\r\nreleased in 1995 in the run-up to the groundbreaking Morgan\r\nStanley IPO of Netscape Communications.\r\n22. In trying to imagine what an itinerant merchant of the Yiwu variety\r\nwould look like in the United States, I thought of a movie from my\r\nchildhood, the 1987 film Planes, Trains and Automobiles, starring\r\nJohn Candy and Steve Martin. Candy plays Del Griffith who is\r\ntrying, and failing, to make a living traveling the country selling\r\nplastic shower-curtain rings.\r\n23. Individual buyers—and sellers—who dominated the platform\r\nwere less likely to pay taxes such as VAT, putting business-toconsumer\r\nwebsites at a disadvantage.\r\n24. In 2004.\r\n25. MIT, Sloan Management Review, 2012, Puneet Manchanda\r\n(University of Michigan) and Junhong Chu (National University of\r\nSingapore Business School).\r\n26. “In the introduction phase, the platform’s growth is primarily\r\nseller-driven: seller growth induces buyers to register, which in\r\nturn leads to more sellers to register, which further encourages\r\nmore buyers to register, etc.”\r\n27. Meaning “Ali prosper.”\r\n28. Senior Vice President Bill Cobb, Chief Financial Officer Rajiv\r\nDutta, and deal specialist Bill Barmier.\r\n29. At the firm’s annual analyst day on January 20, 2005.\r\n30. Like eBay’s acquisition of EachNet, this too ended in failure,\r\nresulting in its sale at a $600 million loss in 2009 to investors that\r\nincluded Silver Lake Partners, Index Ventures, and Andreessen\r\nHorowitz. Embarrassingly for eBay, just eighteen months later\r\nthis team sold Skype to Microsoft for $8.5 billion.\r\n31. Along with Tom Online itself, which was taken private shortly\r\nafter.\r\nChapter Ten: Yahoo’s Billion-Dollar Bet\r\n1. With David Filo.\r\n2. In the first nine months of the year.\r\n3. Launching gbchinese.yahoo.com (“GB” standing for guo biao,\r\nor national standard) and another chinese.yahoo.com in the\r\ncomplex characters used by Chinese speakers outside the\r\nmainland.\r\n4. For a period of fifty years under the Basic Law, part of Deng\r\nXiaoping’s “One Country, Two Systems” formula.\r\n5. Qu Weizhi.\r\n6. Later CEO of the Chinese online video company Youku.\r\n7. Acquired in 1998 by AOL for $407 million.\r\n8. A market that would dramatically reverse the fortunes of\r\nNetEase and propel the rise of another online games specialist\r\nbased in Shanghai, called Shanda (Shengda in Chinese), which\r\nwas listed on the Nasdaq in 2004.\r\n9. Today they represent $18 billion in online revenues, bigger\r\nthan China’s $5 billion movie box office, and accounting for 13\r\npercent of all Internet revenues in the country.\r\n10. Including major portals like Sina, Sohu, and Tom.\r\n11. By the end of 2009, Baidu had captured 63 percent of the\r\nChinese search market, almost double Google’s 33 percent\r\nshare. In March 2010, when Google decided to quit the Chinese\r\nmarket amid bitter accusations of hacking and the pressures of\r\ncensorship, Baidu would reign supreme with over 75 percent of\r\nthe market by the end of the year.\r\n12. Zhou had accused the CNNIC of lacking a legal foundation.\r\n13. Called Yisou.\r\n14. To improve its advertising business by matching it more closely\r\nwith its users’ search queries, Yahoo made a $1.3 billion\r\npurchase of Overture in 2003.\r\n15. Qihoo 360, which went public on the Nasdaq in March 2011,\r\nwould become best known for its free antivirus software, which\r\nwould bring Zhou once again into conflict with Baidu and others,\r\nincluding Yahoo. In China, and among some former Yahoo\r\ncolleagues in the United States, Zhou Hongyi developed a\r\nreputation as “the father of malware in China,” a label he\r\nvigorously disputed. In December 2015, Zhou led a consortium of\r\ninvestors to take Qihoo back into private hands for $9.3 billion,\r\nwith plans to delist the company from the New York Stock\r\nExchange in the first half of 2016.\r\n16. In May 2015, Yahoo injected its 384 million shares in Alibaba,\r\nworth more than $33 billion, just shy of Yahoo’s total valuation,\r\ninto a new entity, “SpinCo,” in an effort to avoid paying over $10\r\nbillion in U.S. taxes.\r\n17. The gathering was an off-site summit hosted by the Hua Yuan\r\nScience and Technology Association (HYSTA), a group of Silicon\r\nValley–based entrepreneurs and engineers mostly hailing from\r\nChina, ahead of their annual conference at the Santa Clara\r\nConvention Center.\r\n18. The Yahoo-Alibaba transaction has proved so successful that\r\nmany have claimed responsibility for teeing up the Jack-Jerry\r\nmeeting at Pebble Beach. Jack has credited, among others, Wu\r\nYing from UTStarcom, Liu Erfei of Merrill Lynch, and Deng\r\nZhonghan of Vimicro Corporation. Joe Tsai says, “Of course\r\neighteen different people took credit for putting together that\r\nmeeting. It was the Hua Yuan event [that] took credit. Everybody\r\ndid.” He added, “If you knew each other . . . you were at the\r\nsame conference.”\r\n19. Traveling to Beijing with Jerry were Yahoo CEO Terry Semel and\r\nCFO Sue Decker and corporate development executive Toby\r\nCoppel.\r\n20. A twenty-four-year veteran of Warner Bros., where he rose to\r\nbecome chairman and co-CEO.\r\n21. Li, a protégé of Jiang Zemin, was in charge of propaganda for\r\nthe Communist Party, a post he was appointed to in 2002. He\r\nserved in that capacity for a decade, overseeing the extensive\r\nsystem of censorship for the Internet.\r\n22. The company had listed the year before and had a market cap of\r\nmore than $2.2 billion, with revenues of $165 million.\r\n23. Instead, he dreamed of turning his company into the Disney of\r\nChina, having earlier that year taken a 19.5 percent stake in Sina\r\nas the first step in a hostile takeover (which never materialized).\r\n24. After selling part of its 40 percent stake in Taobao to Alibaba for\r\n$360 million.\r\n25. In a talk at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View,\r\nCalifornia, hosted by HYSTA, whose conference had helped teeup\r\nthe original deal.\r\n26. Yahoo also bought out a SoftBank investment in Taobao for $360\r\nmillion, half of which SoftBank then used to acquire more shares\r\nin Alibaba, in addition to another $30 million to exercise\r\nconvertible notes it had purchased in 2003.\r\n27. The amount was so large that, on hearing the news of the\r\ninvestment, one CEO of a smaller e-commerce player recounted\r\nto me, “I thought the news must be fake, many people did. One\r\nhundred million dollars would have been a big number, but one\r\nbillion dollars? I had never imagined such a large number.”\r\n28. Now CEO of Shazam.\r\n29. Once he had established Qihoo 360, using the proceeds of\r\nYahoo’s investment, Zhou set about building a product designed\r\nto help users uninstall the very product he himself had built at\r\n3721, which had since been rebranded Yahoo Messenger, but\r\nwhich he now described as malware that should be removed.\r\n30. huoyan-1989@yahoo.com.cn.\r\n31. The Beijing State Security Bureau issued a Notice of Evidence\r\nCollection and requested “email account registration information\r\nfor huoyan-1989@yahoo.com.cn, all login times, corresponding\r\nIP addresses, and relevant email content from February 22,\r\n2004,” from Yahoo China’s offices in Beijing.\r\n32. Including Human Rights Watch, the Committee to Protect\r\nJournalists, and Reporters Without Borders.\r\n33. Who had already taken flak from Alibaba’s rival eBay for\r\ncommitting to the event.\r\n34. The House Foreign Affairs Committee.\r\n35. After fielding an enquiry from the U.S. embassy about the\r\nbackground of Google’s decision, I found myself being quoted\r\nlater on in a cable leaked by Wikileaks. Rather disappointingly,\r\nno one took much notice.\r\nChapter Eleven: Growing Pains\r\n1. A number of Alibaba veterans left the firm, including\r\ncofounder Toto Sun, CTO John Wu, and COO Li Qi, whom Jack\r\nhad first worked with at China Pages.\r\n2. Maggie Wu (Wu Wei), who still serves today as the\r\ncompany’s CFO.\r\n3. Before starting his own private equity fund, Vision Knight\r\nCapital.\r\n4. And its domestic site alibaba.com.cn.\r\n5. And hold for two years.\r\n6. Peter Woo’s Wharf, Robert Kuok’s Kerry Properties, and the\r\nKwok family’s Sun Hung Kai Properties.\r\n7. The offering priced Alibaba’s shares at more than 106 times\r\nits 2007 forecast earnings versus forty-one times for Google, or\r\nforty-five times for its old rival Global Sources.\r\n8. A five-bedroom, 7,000-square-foot property for which he paid\r\nmore than $5,400 per square foot. He purchased the penthouse\r\napartment complete with private roof garden from developer\r\nKerry Properties, one of the cornerstone investors in the IPO.\r\n9. The previous year Alibaba.com generated $170 million in\r\nrevenues and $28 million in net profit.\r\n10. On its Alimama platform.\r\n11. In September 2008, Alibaba launched the first phase of its “Big\r\nTaobao Strategy,” integrating Taobao.com and the online\r\nadvertising platform Alimama to build “the world’s largest ecommerce\r\necosystem.”\r\n12. After a four-and-a-half-year life span as a publicly listed\r\ncompany, in June 2012 Alibaba.com was absorbed back into\r\nparent Alibaba Group, with shareholders paid the same price as\r\nin the original 2007 IPO.\r\n13. Valuing Yahoo’s shares at a 61 percent premium over the market\r\nprice.\r\n14. Estimated at over 99 percent.\r\n15. Including Carl Icahn. But Yahoo’s efforts to strike a search deal\r\nwith Microsoft’s rival Google killed any prospect for the deal.\r\n16. Who was still the representative for Yahoo on Alibaba’s board.\r\n17. Gady Epstein at Forbes.\r\n18. The sale for about $100 million netted them a pretax paper gain\r\nof $98 million. The sale released cash Bartz badly needed to\r\nshore up investor support.\r\n19. In 2009 and 2010.\r\n20. Elvis Lee.\r\n21. Alibaba said that majority ownership was transferred in 2009 to\r\ncomply with regulations, then full ownership transfer completed in\r\n2010.\r\n22. Governing Internet payment, mobile phone payment, bank card–\r\nrelated services, issuance and acceptance of prepaid card\r\npayments, and currency exchange.\r\n23. The talks had been initiated with Jerry Yang and were continued\r\nby the two companies’ CFOs before breaking down that summer.\r\n24. In an interview on July 7, 2011, with China Entrepreneur\r\nmagazine (Zhongguo Qi Ye Jia).\r\n25. In a June 2011 interview at the Wall Street Journal’s All Things\r\nDigital conference in California.\r\n26. By June 2015, when Alipay was valued by private investors as\r\nhigh as $50 billion, the $6 billion cap on a stake then worth more\r\nthan $18 billion would look like a very raw deal for Alibaba\r\ninvestors like Yahoo.\r\n27. Three months earlier Alibaba had announced it would take its\r\nHong Kong–listed subsidiary Alibaba.com back into private\r\nhands, paying the same price for the shares as the company had\r\nlisted in 2007 (a 60.4 percent premium on the shares). This\r\ncleaned the way for the IPO of the whole Alibaba Group in 2014.\r\nChapter Twelve: Icon or Icarus?\r\n1. Losing in the process the long-standing arrangement to\r\nhosting U.S. presidents visiting New York City.\r\n2. A year earlier Jack had become chairman of Alibaba, with Joe\r\nTsai becoming executive vice chairman. Jonathan Lu would last\r\nbarely two years in the job. Both he and his successor, Daniel\r\nZhang, would face the unenviable task of trying to fill Jack’s\r\nshoes.\r\n3. Including any impairment of the “trusted status of the\r\necosystem” or Alibaba’s “culture, mission, and values.”\r\n4. The ranks of the Alibaba Partnership can be refreshed\r\nthrough the admission of new partners each year. Those\r\nappointed typically have more than five years’ service, and their\r\nelection is subject to the approval of 75 percent of all partners. A\r\nPartnership Committee of five, including Jack and Joe,\r\nadministers the structure.\r\n5. Drawn from Alibaba’s finance and logistics affiliates.\r\n6. Jack, Lucy Peng (Peng Lei), Trudy Dai (Dai Shan), Jane\r\nJiang (Jiang Fang), Jin Jianhang, and Eddie Wu (Wu Yongming).\r\n7. The new members are: Yongfu Yu, president of Alibaba’s\r\nmobile business unit and its advertising platform Alimama;\r\nJunfang Zheng, Alibaba Group’s deputy CFO; Ying Zhao, vice\r\npresident of Ant Financial; and Lijun Sun, general manager of\r\nrural Taobao marketplace. This is the first time that Alibaba has\r\nadded new members to its partnership since the IPO in\r\nSeptember 2014. In its prospectus, Alibaba said that to be\r\neligible for election, a partner candidate must have “continued\r\nservice with Alibaba Group and/or our related companies or\r\naffiliates for, in most cases, not less than five years,” in which\r\ncase Yongfu Yu is an exception. Yu was the chairman and CEO\r\nof UCWeb, a mobile Internet technology and service provider\r\nthat was acquired by Alibaba in 2014.\r\n8. The Securities and Futures Commission.\r\n9. In 2007 in Hong Kong, one-quarter of the Alibaba.com IPO\r\nshares went to individual investors.\r\n10. After New York, Alibaba’s global road show took in Boston, San\r\nFrancisco, Hong Kong, Singapore, and London. Management\r\ndivided up into two teams, each fronted by Jack or Joe.\r\n11. As the company approached the one-year anniversary of the\r\nIPO, concerns grew about the expiration of the “lockup”—shares\r\nthat key investors were not permitted to sell for the first year—of\r\n1.6 billion of its 2.5 billion shares.\r\n12. In November 2013, Zhejiang Alibaba E-Commerce Company\r\nLimited was restructured to become Alibaba Small and Micro\r\nFinancial Services Group. Jack saw his shareholding reduced\r\nfrom 80 percent to about 8 percent in the new company, or no\r\ngreater than his shareholding in Alibaba Group.\r\n13. Variously described as a “white paper” or as merely minutes of a\r\nmeeting.\r\n14. Sina Weibo.\r\n15. The head of the SAIC’s department of online commerce.\r\n16. And one day after Yahoo announced it was creating a new\r\nstructure—which it hoped would minimize its tax liabilities—to\r\nspin off a 15 percent stake in Alibaba.\r\n17. Revenue rose 40 percent to $4.22 billion, but came in below the\r\naverage estimate of $4.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.\r\n18. Zhang is the son-in-law of Gu Mu, a former key aide to Deng\r\nXiaoping who had accompanied him on his tour of southern\r\nChina, opening the door to entrepreneurs.\r\n19. At a dinner in London in October 2015.\r\n20. Which given anticorruption campaigns requires careful curation.\r\n21. Xi had recently finished up a stint as party secretary of Zhejiang\r\nProvince.\r\n22. China has a reputation as a wild west for a lack of respect for\r\nintellectual property rights, justified by the rampant piracy in the\r\nmarket. But it isn’t due to a lack of laws. Since its accession to\r\nthe World Trade Organization in 2001, China has set up an\r\nelaborate framework of trademark, patents, and copyright laws. A\r\nsurvey conducted in 2015 by the American Chamber of\r\nCommerce in China found that 85 percent of respondents\r\nbelieved China’s IPR enforcement had improved in the last five\r\nyears, but 80 percent were concerned about ineffective\r\nenforcement.\r\n23. Or selling a range of fake items on four occasions.\r\n24. Where merchants are suspected of committing a criminal\r\noffense, Alibaba will escalate the case to the local Administration\r\nof Industry and Commerce or to the police, which has an officer\r\nstationed at Alibaba headquarters who is dedicated to tracking\r\nthe sale of illicit goods, or the sale of illegal products such as\r\nguns.\r\n25. Tmall merchants are required to furnish more evidence of their\r\nauthorization to trade from brand owners.\r\n26. Taobao’s and Tmall’s search algorithms are heavily driven by\r\nhistorical trading volumes.\r\n27. Known as the “Big Four Unions,” based in Hangzhou and other\r\nlocations.\r\n28. VIP Shop, Melishuo, and Mogujie.\r\n29. Jumei.\r\n30. Dangdang and Amazon.cn.\r\n31. Womai and Yihaodian, invested by Walmart.\r\n32. 19.9 percent. Suning, shelling out 14 billion yuan—$2.3 billion—\r\nbecame a 1.1 percent stakeholder in Alibaba.\r\n33. Also known as Jingdong, formerly 360Buy.\r\n34. In the run-up to JD’s IPO, Alibaba rival Tencent took a 15 percent\r\nstake and folded its own struggling e-commerce offerings into the\r\ncompany.\r\n35. Wei xin (micro message) in Chinese.\r\n36. By Andreessen Horowitz.\r\n37. WeChat’s popularity owes much to its personalized feel, tailored\r\nto the needs and mind-sets of China’s mobile masses. But users\r\ncan control the information they share with strangers, and unlike\r\nthe Twitter-like Weibo the total number of followers on WeChat is\r\ncapped at 5,000. Building on Weibo’s success as a home for\r\ncelebrities and brands, WeChat also offers more than 8.5 million\r\npublic accounts.\r\n38. A modern twist on the traditional seasonal offerings of money to\r\nfamily and friends.\r\n39. The initiative ran into headwinds in 2012 when its launch partner,\r\nthe Taiwanese hardware company Acer, pulled out. This was\r\nreportedly following pressure exerted from Google, which leveled\r\naccusations that Alibaba was deploying a “noncompatible”\r\nversion of Android.\r\n40. Alibaba acquired an 18 percent stake in Sina Weibo in 2014. But\r\nby this point Weibo had lost much of its luster to WeChat.\r\n41. UCWeb.\r\n42. Weilidai (“a tiny bit of loan”).\r\n43. Meaning “quickly hail a cab.”\r\n44. Meaning “beep beep, hail a cab.”\r\n45. Uber was next to step up to the subsidy plate, shelling out an\r\nestimated $1 billion in China in 2015 to win over drivers and\r\ncustomers, aided by a $1.2 billion fund-raising exercise.\r\n46. Some foreign observers make the mistake of believing that\r\n“Shanghai is New York City and Beijing is Washington, D.C.,” but\r\nthis vastly understates Beijing’s importance as a business hub—\r\nand understates the fact that local government in Shanghai is\r\nmuch more of a force in local business than in Beijing.\r\n47. Even recruiting talent from Shanghai for Alibaba’s Hangzhou\r\nheadquarters can be a challenge, as the office lies some\r\ndistance from the city’s train station. To attract and retain\r\nShanghai-based talent, Alibaba offers special buses to and from\r\nShanghai each weekend to ferry employees, who stay in\r\nHangzhou only four nights a week.\r\n48. Describes the twin-pronged strategy comprising the “Silk Road\r\nEconomic Belt,” a series of land routes from China across central\r\nAsia to the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, complemented by\r\n“The Twenty-First-Century Maritime Silk Road” to reinforce\r\nexisting sea trade routes.\r\n49. General partner.\r\n50. Yunfeng’s name in English translates as “cloud and the cutting\r\nedge of a sword.” The combination of Jack’s first name “Yun” and\r\nDavid Yu’s given name “Feng.”\r\n51. Yu first rose to prominence with the sale of his display advertising\r\ncompany Target Media to rival Focus Media in 2006.\r\n52. Other partners include Shen Guojun from Intime Investment, Shi\r\nYuzhu from gaming company Giant Interactive, Liu Yonghao of\r\nNew Hope Group, Wang Yusuo from ENN Group, Jason Jiang\r\nfrom Focus Media, Xu Hang from Shenzhen Mindray Medical,\r\nChen Yihong from China Dongxiang Group, Zhou Xin from e-\r\nHouse, Wang Jianguo from Five Star, Zhou Shaoxiong from\r\nSeptwolves, Wang Xuning from Joyong Holdings, and Zhang\r\nYoucai from Unifront Holdings.\r\n53. One example is the September 2015 announcement that Alibaba\r\nhad established Alibaba Sports Group along with Yunfeng\r\nCapital and Sina (the parent of Sina Weibo, in which Alibaba is\r\nan investor) in an effort to “reshape China’s sports industry\r\nthrough the Internet.”\r\n54. Cofounder David Yu, for example, also serves on the board of\r\nAlibaba-invested Huayi Brothers Media Group. His mother, Wang\r\nYulian, is also a partner at Yunfeng and the largest shareholder\r\nin Ant Financial, after Jack and Simon Xie, holding a reported 4.6\r\npercent stake.\r\n55. As a General Partner.\r\n56. As a Limited Partner.\r\n57. The military retreat of the Red Army from 1934 to 1935.\r\n58. As a sign of its commitment to boosting the sale of imported\r\nproducts in China, Alibaba branded Singles’ Day in 2015 as the\r\n“11/11 Global Shopping Festival.” Yet the company has a long\r\nway to go to secure a sufficient range of imported items to\r\ncompete with the overseas sites that many Chinese shoppers\r\nhave already discovered.\r\n59. Including the mobile search player Quixey, Amazon Prime\r\ncompetitor Shoprunner, game developer Kabam, and mobile\r\nmessaging app Tango.\r\n60. Building on its earliest U.S. investments in e-commerce\r\ncompanies Auctiva and Vendio, Alibaba launched its own U.S.\r\nwebsite, 11Main.com, in an effort to reach directly to American\r\nconsumers. But the effort failed, and in June 2015 Alibaba\r\ndisposed of its interest.\r\n61. He also previously served in the George W. Bush administration,\r\nincluding as senior adviser on foreign affairs to Secretary of State\r\nCondoleezza Rice.\r\n62. Deputy assistant to the president for legislative affairs, serving\r\nGeorge W. Bush.\r\n63. Since Alibaba donated 0.3 percent of its annual revenue to a\r\ncompany foundation, but the new trust is much larger.\r\n64. Presumably to include the returns on his Yunfeng Capital\r\ninvestments.\r\n65. In the northeastern city of Yabuli.\r\n66. On social media in China, there has been intense speculation\r\nabout the state of health of Jack’s own family members, but Jack\r\nhas not spoken publicly about this.\r\n67. The Communist Party runs special farms, off-limits to the public\r\nand media, to ensure high-quality food supplies for its senior\r\nleaders, who also receive privileged access to the best medical\r\ncare, provided by military hospitals.\r\n68. To Bloomberg TV’s Emily Chang in November 2015.\r\n69. Real estate billionaire Xu Jiaxin.\r\n70. ChinaVision.\r\n71. 3.6 billion yuan ($565 million).\r\n72. In a deal announced in October 2015 valuing Youku at more than\r\n$5 billion.\r\n73. Victor founded Youku after working as COO of Sohu. Youku\r\nacquired its largest competitor to become Youku-Tudou.\r\n74. 461 million people in mid-2015 according to CNNIC.\r\n75. In 2014, the territory had been brought to a standstill by the\r\nOccupy Central movement, or Umbrella Revolution, a student-led\r\nprotest against the lack of genuine democracy and other\r\nfreedoms. Although the crisis ended peacefully, the underlying\r\ntensions that fueled it remain ever present.\r\nAbout the Author\r\nDUNCAN CLARK, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker and\r\nfluent Mandarin speaker, has lived and worked in China for over\r\ntwenty years. He heads a team of more than one hundred at BDA\r\nChina, the investment advisory firm he founded in Beijing in 1994. An\r\nexpert on China’s Internet sector, Clark is a former Visiting Scholar at\r\nStanford University, where he welcomed Jack Ma onstage as a\r\nkeynote speaker, along with the leaders of other leading Chinese\r\nInternet firms including Baidu, Sina, and Tencent.\r\nDiscover great authors, exclusive offers, and more at hc.com.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nCOVER DESIGN BY SARA WOOD\r\nCOVER PHOTOGRAPH © CHAD INGRAHAM/REDUX\r\nCopyright\r\nALIBABA.
