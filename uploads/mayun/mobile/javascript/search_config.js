About the Publisher","Maps","","","Introduction                          Alibaba is an unusual name for a Chinese company. Its founder, Jack                 Ma, a former English teacher, is an unlikely corporate titan.                       Yet  the  house  that  Jack  built  is  home  to  the  largest  virtual                 shopping mall in the world, soon to overtake Walmart in the amount                 of goods sold. The company’s IPO on the New York Stock Exchange                 in  September  2014  raised  $25  billion,  the  largest  stock  market                 flotation  in  history.  In  the  months  that  followed,  Alibaba’s  shares                  soared, making it one of the top ten most valuable companies in the                 world, worth almost $300 billion. Alibaba became the most valuable                 Internet  company  in  the  world  after  Google,  its  shares  worth  more                 than Amazon and eBay combined. Nine days before the IPO, Jack                 celebrated his fiftieth birthday, the soaring value of his stake making                 him the richest man in Asia.                       But  since  that  peak  Alibaba’s  life  as  a  publicly  listed  company                 has not gone according to plan. Its shares fell by half from their post-                  IPO  peak,  even  briefly  falling  below  the  initial  offer  price.  Investor                 concerns  were  sparked  in  early  2015  by  a  surprising  entanglement                 with a government agency over intellectual property, then fueled by                 the  slowing  Chinese  economy  and  volatile  stock  markets,  which                 dragged down Alibaba’s shares in their wake.                       Despite the ups and downs of the stock market, with a dominant                 share of the e-commerce market, Alibaba is uniquely well positioned                  to  benefit  from  the  rise  of  China’s  consuming  classes.  Over  400                 million people, more than the population of the United States, make                 purchases on Alibaba’s websites each year. The tens of millions of                 packages  generated  each  day  account  for  almost  two-thirds  of  all                 parcel deliveries in China.                       Alibaba  has  transformed  the  way  Chinese  shop,  giving  them                 access  to  a  range  and  quality  of  items  that  previous  generations","could  only  dream  of.  Like  Amazon  in  the  West,  Alibaba  brings  the                 convenience  of  home  delivery  to  millions  of  consumers.  Yet  this                 comparison  understates  Alibaba’s  impact.  Taobao,  its  online                 shopping website, has given many Chinese people their first sense of                  being truly valued as a customer. Alibaba is playing a pivotal role in                 China’s economic restructuring, helping move the country away from                 a “Made in China” past to a “Bought in China” present.                       The  Old  China  growth  model  lasted  three  decades.  Based  on                 manufacturing,  construction,  and  exports,  it  delivered  hundreds  of                 millions  out  of  poverty  but  left  China  with  a  bitter  legacy  of                 overcapacity,  overbuilding,  and  pollution.  Now  a  new  model  is                 emerging, one centered on catering to the needs of a middle class                  expected to grow from 300 million to half a billion people within ten                 years.                       Jack, more than any other, is the face of the new China. Already                 something  of  a  folk  hero  at  home,  he  stands  at  the  intersection  of                 China’s newfound cults of consumerism and entrepreneurship.                       His fame extends well beyond China’s borders. A meeting (and a                 selfie)  with  Jack  is  coveted  by  presidents,  prime  ministers  and                  princes,  CEOs,  entrepreneurs,  investors,  and  movie  stars.  Jack                 regularly  shares  the  stage  with  the  world’s  political  and  corporate                 elite.  A  masterful  public  speaker,  more  often  than  not  he  outshines                 them.  To  go  onstage  after  Jack  is  a  losing  proposition.  In  a                 remarkable reversal of protocol, President Obama even volunteered                 to act as moderator for Jack at a Q\&A session during the November                 2015  APEC  meeting  in  Manila.  At  the  World  Economic  Forum  in                 Davos  in  January  2016,  Jack  dined  with  Leonardo  DiCaprio,  Kevin                  Spacey, and Bono, along with the CEOs of the Coca-Cola Company,                 DHL,  and  JPMorgan  Chase.  The founder  of another  China  Internet                 company  remarked  to  me:  “It  was  almost  as  though  Alibaba’s  PR                 department was writing Obama’s script!”","Tom Cruise and Jack Ma in Shanghai, September 6, 2015, at the Chinese premiere of                  Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, which was financed in part by Alibaba Pictures. Alibaba                        Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been demonstrating his                 commitment to learning Mandarin Chinese in speeches he has made                 since  2014,  starting  at  Tsinghua  University  in  Beijing.  But  Jack,                 English  teacher  turned  tycoon,  has  been  wowing  crowds  in  both                 English  and  Chinese  at  conferences  around  the  world  for  over                  seventeen years.                       I  first  met  Jack  in  the  summer  of  1999,  a  few  months  after  he                 founded  Alibaba  in  a  small  apartment  in  Hangzhou,  some  hundred                 miles  southwest  of  Shanghai.  On  my  first  visit,  I  could  count  the                 number of cofounders by the toothbrushes jammed into mugs on a                 shelf  in  the  bathroom.  In  addition  to  Jack,  there  included  his  wife,                 Cathy, and sixteen others. Jack and Cathy had wagered everything                 they  owned  on  the  company,  including  their  home.  Jack’s  ambition                 then, as it remains today, was breathtaking. He talked of building an                  Internet company that would last eighty years—the typical span of a                 human life. A few years later, he extended Alibaba’s life expectancy                 to “a hundred and two” years, so that the company would span three                 centuries from 1999. From the very beginning, he vowed to take on                 and  topple  the  giants  of  Silicon  Valley.  Within  the  confines  of  that                 modest apartment this should have seemed delusional. Yet there was","something  about  his  passion  for  the  venture  that  made  it  sound                 entirely credible.                       I became an adviser to Alibaba in its early years, helping Jack                 and  his  right-hand  man,  Joe  Tsai,  with  the  company’s  international                  expansion  strategy  and  recommending  to  them  some  of  its  first                 foreign employees. Alibaba has assisted me in my research for this                 book by arranging interviews with senior management and providing                 access  to  the  company  in  various  locations.  But  this  is  an  entirely                 independent  account.  I  have  never  been  an  employee  of  the                 company and have no professional relationship with them today. My                 insights come in part from my brief role during the dot-com boom as                 an adviser to Alibaba and from the proximity that this early contact                  has afforded since. Yet in writing this book, I have been guided also                 by  my  personal  experience  living  in  China  since  1994,  when  the                 Internet  first  came  to  the  country’s  shores,  and  by  my  professional                                                                                                        1                 career. With support from my previous employer Morgan Stanley,  in                 the  summer  of  1994,  I  founded  BDA  China,  a  Beijing-based                  investment  advisory  firm,  which  today  numbers  more  than  one                 hundred  professionals,  consulting  to  investors  and  participants  in                 China’s technology and retail sectors.                       As  part  of  the  remuneration  for  my  advisory  service,  in  early                 2000,  Jack  and  Joe  granted  me  the  right  to  buy  a  few  hundred                 thousand  shares  in  Alibaba  at  just  thirty  cents  each.  When  the                 deadline  was  up  to  buy  the  shares,  in  early  2003,  things  weren’t                 looking so good for the company. The dot-com bubble had burst and                  Alibaba’s  (original)  business  was  struggling.  In  an  error  of  colossal                 proportions, I decided not to buy the shares. In the weeks after the                 company’s September 2014 IPO, this mushroomed into a $30 million                            2                 mistake.   I  would  like  to  thank  you  very  much  for  purchasing  this                 book.  Writing  it  has  proved  (somewhat)  cathartic  as  I  explore  the                  stories  of  others,  like  Goldman  Sachs,  who  underestimated  Jack’s                 tenacity and sold their early stake too soon, and eBay, who dismissed                 his firm as a rival, only to be forced out of the China market within a                 few years.                       Jack  is  different  from  most  of  his  Internet  billionaire  peers.  He                 struggled in math as a student and wears his ignorance of technology                 as  a  badge  of  honor.  His  outsize  ambitions  and  unconventional","strategies won him the nickname “Crazy Jack.” In this book, we will                 explore  his  past  and  quirky  personality  to  learn  the  method  to  his                 madness.                       China’s  e-commerce  market  differs  in  important  ways  from  the                  United States and other Western economies, the legacy of decades                 of state planning  and  the important  role  still  played  by state-owned                 enterprises.  Alibaba  has  sought  out  and  exploited  the  inefficiencies                 these have created, first in e-commerce, now in media and finance.                 His  vision  for  the  company—or  his  own  philanthropic  endeavors—                 now  extends  to  grappling  with  China’s  greatest  challenges,  in                 reforming  health  care,  education,  and  its  approach  to  the                 environment.                        Yet  Alibaba’s  main  business  today  remains  e-commerce,  a                 market  it  helped  create  and  which  it  currently  dominates.  Is  there                 more room for it to grow? Competitors are waiting in the wings. Also                 watching closely is the Chinese government. As Alibaba consolidates                 more  market  power  than  any  other  private  company  ever  has,  can                 Jack keep the government on his side?                       Although most of its operations are in China, Alibaba is pursuing                  an  ambitious  international  expansion.  Newly  appointed  president                 Michael Evans: “We like to say that Alibaba was born in China, but                 we were created for the world.”                       Before we look at the remarkable story of how Alibaba came to                 be, and its goals for the future, let’s start by taking a tour of what Jack                 calls  the  “iron  triangle,”  the  key  underpinning  of  the  company’s                 dominance today: its strengths in e-commerce, logistics, and finance.","Chapter One                                             The Iron Triangle                                    China changed because of us in the past fifteen years.                   We hope in the next fifteen years, the world changes because of us.                                                        —Jack Ma                     On November 11, 2015, in Beijing, in the iconic bubble-like structure                 bathed in blue light known popularly as the “Water Cube,” the venue                  for  the  aquatics  events  in  the  Beijing  Olympics  held  seven  years                 earlier, it wasn’t water that flowed but streams of data. For twenty-four                 hours, without interruption, a huge digital screen flickered with maps,                 charts,  and  news  crawls,  reporting  in  real  time  the  purchases  of                 millions of consumers across China on Alibaba’s websites. In front of                 hundreds  of  journalists  broadcasting  the  event  across  China  and                 around the world, the Water Cube had been repurposed as mission                  control for the Chinese middle class and the merchants marketing to                 them. A four-hour live TV special, the 11/11 Global Festival Shopping                 Gala,  was  broadcast  to  help  keep  shoppers  up  until  midnight,                 featuring  actors  such  as  Kevin  Spacey,  who  appeared  in  a  filmed                 montage  as  his  character  from  House  of  Cards,  President  Frank                 Underwood,  endorsing  Alibaba  as  the  place  to  buy  disposable                 “burner”  cell  phones.  The  gala  show  culminated  in  a  skit  featuring                 Jack’s  face  as  the  new  Bond  girl  before  he  appeared  in  a  tuxedo                  walking alongside Bond actor Daniel Craig for some onstage antics in                 the final countdown to midnight.                       In the first eight minutes of 11/11/15, shoppers made more than                 $1 billion in purchases on Alibaba’s sites. And they kept on shopping.                 As the world’s largest cash register tallied the takings, Jack—seated                 next to his friend, the actor and martial artist Jet Li—couldn’t resist","taking  a  photo  of  the  huge  screen  with  his  cell  phone.

Jack summed up the event: “This is a unique day. We want all the                 manufacturers,  shop  owners  to  be  thankful  for  the  consumers.  We                  want the consumers to have a wonderful day.”                 5                       From just twenty-seven merchants in 2009, over forty thousand                 merchants  and  thirty  thousand  brands  now  participate  in  Singles’","Day. Total sales in 2015 were up 60 percent from the $9 billion of the                 previous  year.  On  that  occasion,  celebrated  at  Alibaba’s  Wetlands                 campus in Hangzhou, the company’s chief strategy officer Dr. Zeng                 Ming  described  the  scene  in  terms  reminiscent  of  Dr.  Frankenstein                  watching his creation stirring from the dead: “The ecosystem has its                 own will to grow.” Alibaba’s executive vice chairman Joe Tsai echoed                 the  sentiment:  “You’re  seeing  the  unleashing  of  the  consumption                 power of the Chinese consumer.”                       This  power  has  long  been  suppressed.  Household  spending  in                 the  United  States  drives  two-thirds  of  the  economy,  but  in  China  it                 barely  accounts  for  one-third.  Compared  to  developed  countries,                 Chinese people don’t consume enough. The reason? They save too                  much  and  spend  too  little.  To  fund  their  future  education,  medical                 expenses,  or  retirement,  many  families  accumulate  substantial                 amounts of mattress money or “precautionary savings.” Also, lacking                 the range or quality of products on offer in the West, consumers in                 China until relatively recently had little enticement to spend more on                 themselves.                       Addressing  an  audience  at  Stanford  University  in  September                  2015, Jack observed that “in the U.S. when the economy is slowing                 down  it  means  people  don’t  have  money  to  spend.”  But,  he  joked,                 “You guys know how to spend tomorrow’s money or future money or                 other people’s money. China’s been poor for so many years, we put                 our money in the bank.”                       Old habits die hard, but a new habit—buying online—is changing                 the way consumers in China behave. Alibaba is at the forefront of this                 shift.  Its  most  popular  website  is  Taobao.com,  China’s  third  most                  visited  website  and  the  world’s  twelfth.  A  common  saying  today  in                                                         6                 China is wanneng de taobao,  meaning “you can find everything on                 Taobao.” Amazon has been called “the Everything Store.” Taobao too                 sells (almost) everything, everywhere. Just as Google is synonymous                                                                      7                 with searching online, in China to “tao”  something is shorthand for                 searching for a product online.                       Alibaba has a much greater impact on China’s retail sector than                 Amazon does in the United States. Thanks to Taobao and its sister                 site, Tmall, Alibaba is effectively China’s largest retailer. Amazon, by                 contrast, only became one of the top ten retailers in America in 2013.","Although Alibaba launched Taobao in 2003, it was only five years                 later  that  it  really  came  into  its  own.  Until  then  China’s  countless                 factories churned out products mostly for buyers overseas, shipped to                 stock the shelves of retailers like Walmart and Target. But the global                  financial crisis in 2008 changed everything. China’s traditional export                 markets  were  thrown  into  a  tailspin.  Taobao  pried  open  the  factory                 gates  to  consumers  in  China  instead.  The  Chinese  government’s                 response  to  the  2008  crisis  was  to  double  down  on  the  Old  China                 model—pumping money into the economy that fueled a massive real                 estate  bubble,  excess  capacity,  and  yet  more  pollution.  As  the  bills                 came  in,  it  became  clear  that  the  much-needed  rebalancing  of  the                 Chinese  economy  toward  consumption  could  no  longer  be                  postponed. And Alibaba is one of the biggest beneficiaries.                       Jack likes to say that his company’s success was an accident:                 “Alibaba  might  as  well  be  known  as  ‘one  thousand  and  one                 mistakes.’” In its early years, he gave three explanations as to why                 the  company  survived:  “We  didn’t  have  any  money,  we  didn’t  have                 any technology, and we didn’t have a plan.”                       But  let’s  look  at  the  three  real  factors  that  underpin  Alibaba’s                  success  today:  the  company’s  competitive  edge  in  e-commerce,                 logistics,  and  finance,  what  Jack  describes  as  Alibaba’s  “iron                 triangle.”                       Alibaba’s  e-commerce  sites  offer  an  unparalleled  variety  of                 goods  to  consumers.  Its  logistics  offering  ensures  those  goods  are                 delivered quickly and reliably. And the company’s finance subsidiary                 ensures that buying on Alibaba is easy and worry free.                     The E-commerce Edge                  Unlike Amazon, Alibaba’s consumer websites Taobao and Tmall carry                                    8                 no  inventory.   They  serve  as  platforms  for  other  merchants  to  sell                 their wares. Taobao consists of nine million storefronts run by small                 traders or individuals. Attracted by the site’s huge user base, these                 “micro  merchants”  choose  to  set  up  their  stalls  on  Taobao  in  part                 because  it  costs  them  nothing  to  do  so.  Alibaba  charges  them  no                 fees. But Taobao makes money—a lot of it—from selling advertising","space, helping promote those merchants who want to stand out from                 the crowd.                       Merchants  can  advertise  through  paid  listings  or  display  ads.                 Under  the  paid  listing  model,  similar  to  Google’s  AdWords,                  advertisers bid for keywords to give their products a more prominent                 placement  on  Taobao.  They  pay  Alibaba  based  on  the  number  of                 times consumers click on their ads. Merchants can also use a more                 traditional  advertising  model,  paying  based  on  the  number  of  times                 their ads are displayed on Taobao.                       The  old  joke  about  advertising  is  “I  know  at  least  half  of  my                 advertising budget works . . . I just don’t know which half.” But with                 “pay-for-performance” advertising—and a ready market of hundreds                  of millions of consumers—Taobao commands an enormous appeal to                 small merchants.                       Keeping  order  amid  Taobao’s  virtual  alleyways  are  Alibaba’s                                                                  9                 client  service  managers,  the  xiaoer.   Thousands  of  xiaoer  mediate                 any  disputes  that  arise  between  customers  and  merchants.  These                  referees, young employees averaging twenty-seven years old, work                 long hours, often sending messages to vendors late at night.                       The  xiaoer  have  great  powers  of  enforcement,  including  the                 ability  to  shut  down  a  merchant  entirely.  They  can  also  offer                 merchants a carrot: the ability to participate in marketing campaigns.                 Inevitably,  some  merchants  have  sought  to  corrupt  the  xiaoer  by                 offering bribes. Alibaba periodically shuts down merchants caught in                 the act, and an internal disciplinary unit is constantly on the lookout to                  root out graft among its employees.                       But Taobao’s success is not explained by the xiaoer alone. The                 site works because it succeeds in putting the customer first, bringing                 the vibrancy of China’s street markets to the experience of shopping                 online. Buying online is as interactive as in real life. Customers can                                                        10                 use Alibaba’s chat application  to haggle over prices; a vendor might                 hold up a product to his webcam. Shoppers can also expect to score                 discounts  and  free shipping.  Most packages  arrive  with  some  extra                 samples or cuddly toys thrown in, something I have personally grown                 so  used  to  that  when  receiving  Amazon  packages  in  the  United                 States I shake empty boxes in vain. The merchants on Taobao guard                 their reputation with customers fiercely; such is the Darwinian nature","of the competition on the platform. When customers post a negative                 comment about a merchant or a product, they can expect to receive a                 message and offers of refunds or free replacements within minutes.                       Alibaba’s  e-commerce  edge  is  also  honed  by  another  of  its                                         11                 websites,  Tmall.   If  Taobao  can  be  compared  to  a  collection  of                 scrappy market stalls, Tmall is a glitzy shopping mall. Large retailers                 and  even  luxury  brands  sell  their  goods  on  Tmall  and,  for  those                 customers not yet able to afford them, build brand awareness. Unlike                 Taobao,  which  is  free  for  buyers  and  sellers,  merchants  pay                 commissions to Alibaba on the products they sell on Tmall, ranging                                                                                 12                 from 3 to 6 percent depending on the category.  Today Tmall.com is                 the seventh-most-visited website in China.                       In Chinese, the site is called tian mao, or “sky cat.” Its mascot is                 a  black  cat,  to  distinguish  it  from  Taobao’s  alien  doll.  Tmall  is                 increasingly  important  for  Alibaba,  generating  $136  billion  in  gross                                                                     13                 merchandise volume for the company,  closing in on the $258 billion                 sold on Taobao. Alibaba earns almost $10 billion a year in revenue                 from these sites, nearly 80 percent of its total sales.                       Tmall hosts three types of stores on its platform: flagship stores,                 run by a brand itself; authorized stores, set up by a merchant licensed                 to do so by the brand; and specialty stores, which carry the goods of                  more than one brand. The specialty stores account for 90 percent of                 Tmall vendors. More than seventy thousand brands, from China and                 overseas, can be found today on Tmall.                       In the Singles’ Day promotion on Tmall, the most popular brands                 included  foreign  names  such  as  Nike,  Gap,  Uniqlo,  and  L’Oréal  as                 well  as  domestic  players  such  as  smartphone  vendors  Xiaomi  and                 Huawei,  and  consumer  electronics  and  home  appliances  company                  Haier.                       Tmall is a veritable A to Z of brands, from Apple to Zara. Luxury                                                                                                 14                 brands  also  sell  on  the  website,  although  they  are  careful   not  to                 cannibalize sales in their physical stores. The presence of Burberry                 on the site is a sign that Alibaba is no longer just about cheap goods.                       U.S. retailers like Costco and Macy’s are also on Tmall, part of a                  drive by Alibaba to connect them along with other overseas stores to                 customers in China. Costco’s Tmall store drew over 90 million visitors                 to its site in the first two months.","Even  Amazon  is  on  Tmall,  selling  imported  food,  shoes,  toys,                 and kitchenware since 2015. Amazon has long had designs on the                 China market but has had to settle for just 2 percent of it.                       In  addition  to  Taobao  and  Tmall,  Alibaba  operates  a  Groupon-                        15                                                                   16                 style   site  called  Juhuasuan.com.   Juhuasuan  is  the  largest                 product-focused  group-buying  site  in  China.  Buoyed  by  the  huge                 volume of goods on Alibaba’s other sites, it has signed up more than                 200 million users, making it the largest online group-buying site in the                 world. Together, Taobao, Tmall, and Juhuasuan have signed up over                 10 million merchants, offering more than one billion individual items                  for sale.                       Alibaba’s websites are popular in part because, as in the United                 States, shopping online from home can save time and money. More                 than 10 percent of retail purchases in China are made online, higher                 than the 7 percent in the States. Jack has likened e-commerce to a                 “dessert”  in  the  United  States,  whereas  in  China  it  is  the  “main                 course.”  Why?  Shopping  in  China  was  never  a  pleasurable                  experience. Until the arrival of multinational companies like Carrefour                 and Walmart, there were very few retailing chains or shopping malls.                 Most  domestic  retailers  started  as  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).                 With  access  to  a  ready  supply  of  financing,  provided  by  local                 governments or state-owned banks, they tended to view shoppers as                 a  mere  inconvenience.  Other  retailers  were  set  up  by  real  estate                 companies  more  concerned  with  the  value  of  the  land  underneath                 their store than with the customers within.                        A key factor in the success of e-commerce in China is the burden                 of  real  estate  on  traditional  retailers.  Land  is  expensive  in  China                 because  it  is  a  crucial  source  of  income  for  the  government.  Land                 sales account for one-quarter of the government’s fiscal revenues. At                 the local government level they account for more than one-third. One                 prominent e-commerce executive summed it up for me: “Because of                 the  way  our  economy  is  structured,  the  government  has  a  lot  of                  resources.  The  government  decides  the  price  of  land.  The                 government decides how resources are channeled, where money is                 spent.  The  government  relies  too  heavily  on  taxes  and  fees                 associated  with  selling  land.  That  almost  destroyed  the  retail                 business in China, and pushed a lot of demand online. They deprived","offline  retailers  of  the  opportunity  to  benefit  from  rising  consumer                 demand—which they effectively channeled to e-commerce players.”                 Successful  brick-and-mortar  retailers—from  department  stores  to                 restaurants—suffer from success: If they bring in lots of customers to                  their store, they can expect a hefty rent hike when their lease is up for                 renegotiation.                       As  a  consequence,  there  has  been  far  less  investment  in                 marketing, customer service, human resources, or logistics in China’s                 traditional  retail  sector  than  in  the  West.  The  result?  China’s  retail                 market is highly fragmented and inefficient. In the United States, the                 top three grocery chains account for 37 percent of all sales. In China,                 they account for just 7 percent. The largest department stores in the                  United States represent 44 percent of total sales in that segment. In                 China? Just 6 percent.                       Despite  massive  construction  of shopping  malls,  supermarkets,                 and corner stores, China’s offline retail penetration is still extremely                 low. For every person in China there are only six square feet of retail                  space, less than one-quarter the space in the United States.                   17                       China will likely never close the gap. Why should it? Traditional                 retail is hardly a paragon of efficiency. With the burdens of inventory                 and  rental  costs,  offline  stores  are  rapidly  losing  sales  to  online                 players in many product categories.                       In China today, some shop owners are too busy taking care of                 customers online to bother with those who actually wander into their                 store. Many vendors in China have simply dispensed with the shop                  entirely: Why rent an expensive space that is only open at most half                 of every day when your Taobao storefront is open 24/7?                       Nature abhors a vacuum and in China the Internet is filling the                 voids  created  by  a  legacy  of  state  ownership  and  state  planning.                 That’s why shopping online in China is even more popular than in the                 West. Jack summed it up: “In other countries, e-commerce is a way to                 shop; in China it is a lifestyle.”                        Taobao opened the door to online shopping in China, and Tmall                 has  widened  it  even  further.  Taobao’s  early  adopters  were  young,                 digital  natives,  but  increasingly  their  parents  and  grandparents  are                 buying online, too. As the mix of people buying online has broadened,                 so has the mix of products. The most popular items on Alibaba’s sites","are  shoes  and  clothing,  ranging  all  the  way  up  from  socks  and  T-                 shirts to dresses costing tens of thousands of dollars. The day after                 the  country’s  biggest  television  broadcast,  the  Spring  Festival  Gala                 on China Central Television, the dresses worn by the celebrities—or                  approximations  of  them—are  already  on  sale  on  Alibaba’s  sites.                 Many storefronts feature photos of people—including the merchants                 themselves—modeling a wide range of body sizes to make it easy to                 buy  online.  Customers  know  that  if  the  clothes  don’t  fit,  or  are                 defective, they can return them without charge.                       Groceries  are  another  popular  category  because,  as  Jack                 explained, “supermarkets in China were terrible; that’s why we have                 come  out  on  top.”  Already  more  than  40  percent  of  Chinese                  consumers buy their groceries online as compared to just 10 percent                 in the United States. In 2014, online grocery sales in China grew by                 half. Offline, they grew only 7 percent. Tmall offers grocery items in                 more  than  250  cities  in  all  but  six  of  China’s  thirty-two  mainland                 provinces, typically at cheaper prices than in a supermarket. Alibaba                 already  offers  next-day  delivery  of  refrigerated  items  in  more  than                 sixty cities and also features a wide range of imported foods. Working                  with the Washington State Apple Commission, Alibaba secured more                 than  eighty-four  thousand  individual  orders  for  apples  that  were                 picked, packed, and freighted to customers in China within seventy-                 two hours, amounting to 167 metric tons and equivalent in volume to                 the capacity of three Boeing 747s.                       Young  mothers  are  a  key  customer  base  for  Alibaba.  James                 Chiu, a representative from the Dutch infant formula company Friso,                 which was showcased by Alibaba on Singles’ Day 2015, said that for                  young mothers in China, “e-commerce is not a channel, it’s a lifestyle,                 an ecosystem.” The group sold almost $10 million worth of products                 on Singles’ Day by 6 A.M. alone, more than their 2014 total.                       Computers, communication products, and consumer electronics                 are  popular  items  on  Taobao,  as  are  household  goods,  from  hair                 dryers and microwave ovens to TVs and washing machines. Here the                 impact on offline retailers has been especially dramatic. On Singles’                  Day, Alibaba’s sales of home appliances regularly exceed half of the                 annual  sales  of  the  country’s  largest  consumer  goods  retailers.  In                 August 2015, Alibaba acquired 20 percent of retailer Suning for $4.6","billion. Selling electronics and white goods as well as books and baby                 products,  Suning  operates  more  than  sixteen  hundred  stores  in                 almost  three  hundred  cities.  The  deal  with  Alibaba,  part  of  the                 growing  “omni-channel”  or  “online  to  offline”  (“O2O”)  trend,  means                  that even if customers go to Suning merely to test out a product, the                 company can capture some of the revenue when they buy the item                 online.                       Alibaba  sells  automobiles  online,  too.  General  Motors  brands                 Chevrolet and Buick both operate stores on Tmall, where they also                 market interest-free auto loans, a critical competitive tool in a market                 that is already GM’s largest. Automobiles are a popular category on                 Singles’  Day,  as  buyers  can  expect  to  score  discounts  as  well  as                  beneficial  payment  terms.  Real  estate  is  another  category.  The                 superrich can browse lists of entire islands for sale in Canada, Fiji, or                 Greece.                       Taobao is famous for offering all sorts of outlandish items, too.                 One  university  student  gained  notoriety  for  offering  earrings  that                 feature  dead  mosquitoes—like  the  insects,  each  pair  is  unique.                 Another vendor even sold bottled farts online.                        Taobao  isn’t  just  about  products.  Customers  can  also  buy                 services, too. Artists and musicians find commissions on the site. The                 sheer  variety  of  services  on  offer  provides  a  revealing  insight  into                 China’s  fast-changing  social  mores.  Young  men  can  hire  a  fake                 girlfriend  to  attend  social  events,  or  outsource  a  breakup  with  their                 real  girlfriend  to  a  specialist  on  Taobao.  Wives  worried  about  a                 straying  husband  can  subscribe  to  a  counseling  service  offering                 techniques  to  fend  off  a  mistress.  Busy  young  urbanites  can  hire                  surrogates  on  Taobao  to  visit  their  parents.  To  overcome  a  chronic                 lack of donors, Alibaba’s group buying site, Juhuasuan, even teamed                 up  with  sperm  banks  in  seven  provinces  to  entice  qualified  donors                 with an offer of more than eight hundred dollars. This is the going rate                 offline, but with the power of online marketing more than twenty-two                 thousand men had applied within forty-eight hours.                       Feel-good  items  such  as  cosmetics  and  jewelry  are  popular                  items  on  Taobao,  too.  Merchants  are  drawn  to  the  category  for                 commanding some of the highest margins for any product sold online.                 Today  an  estimated  42  percent  of  skin-care  products  in  China  are","sold online, a number boosted by the wide availability of goods sold                 by  merchants  who  have  found  a  way  to  circumvent  high  import                 duties.                       Counterfeit  goods  are  thought  to  be  the  world’s  largest  illicit                  industry,  more  profitable  by  some  estimates  than  the  drug  trade.                 Sales  by  merchants  of  pirated  goods  on  Taobao  helped  boost  the                 early  popularity  of  the  website  and  continue  to  be  a  bone  of                 contention  for  brand  owners.  China’s  fake  goods  can  be  so  high                 quality  that  they  defy  detection  even  by  legitimate  manufacturers,                 made by “extra shift” production runs in the same plant as the real                 items,  typically  using  leftover  materials.  As  workshop  to  the  world,                 China  is  a  big  part  of  the  piracy  problem.  But  as  it  becomes  the                  world’s largest consumer base, it has to be part of the solution, too.                       Speaking  at  a  fair  for  online  merchants  in  Guangzhou,  Jack                        18                 once   addressed  these  concerns:  “Are  there  any  counterfeit                 products  [on  Taobao]?  Of  course  there  are.  This  is  a  complicated                 society.  Taobao  itself  does  not  make  fake  products,  but  Taobao  is                  providing  some  degree  of  convenience  for  those  who  make  fake                 products.  Taobao  is  a  digital  platform.”  Jack  then  urged  the                 merchants  who  sell  genuine  products  on  Taobao  to  unite,  enforce                 regulations, and kick out the merchants who sell fakes, telling them:                 “We keep track of all of you who make and sell fake products. You will                 be punished.”                       But Alibaba’s efforts have not always convinced brand owners. In                 November  2011,  the  same  month  that  Baidu  was  removed  from  its                                                                                          19                 list, Taobao was added to the “Notorious Markets List”  published by                 the  Office  of  the  United  States  Trade  Representative  (USTR),                 America’s chief trade negotiator. Inclusion on the notorious markets                 list  not  only  threatened  to  damage  Alibaba’s  reputation  with                 merchants, but also complicated its plans for an IPO. In response, the                  company  ramped  up  its  efforts  to  weed  out  the  largest  traders  of                 counterfeit items from Taobao, prompting a number of them to form                 an  “Anti-Taobao  Alliance”  and  march  on  Alibaba’s  offices  in  Hong                 Kong  in  protest.  Alibaba  also  raised  the  bar  for  vendors  selling  on                 Tmall, increasing service charges and deposits, a move that triggered                 an  angry  response  from  thousands  of  merchants  who  accused","Taobao  of  monopoly  practices  and  marched  on  Alibaba’s                 headquarters in Hangzhou.                       To  appease  the  USTR  Alibaba  also  ramped  up  its  lobbying                          20                 efforts  and in December 2012 Taobao was removed from its list—                 although  a  number  of  U.S.  software,  clothing,  and  shoe                 manufacturers  have  continued  since  then  to  push  for  sanctions                 against Taobao to be reimposed.                       As the perennial tensions over piracy highlight, the sheer volume                 of  goods  on  sale  on  its  platforms  means  Alibaba  has  to  strike  a                 delicate  balance  between  serving  the  interests  of  consumers  and                  merchants as well as protecting its own reputation. Binding Alibaba                 even  closer  to  buyers  and  sellers  is  the  second  edge  of  the  iron                 triangle: logistics.                     The Logistics Edge                  On  Singles’  Day  2015,  orders  placed  on  Alibaba’s  websites                 generated  467  million  packages,  requiring  more  than  1.7  million                 couriers  and  four  hundred  thousand  vehicles  to  deliver  the  goods.                 China  today  has  a  veritable  army  of  couriers.  On  foot,  bicycles,                 electronic bikes, trucks, and trains they are the unsung heroes of the                 country’s e-commerce revolution.                        Chinese  consumers  spent  more  than  $32  billion  on  package                 deliveries in 2014. The number increased by more than 40 percent in                 a year. But the volume is set to grow dramatically in the years ahead:                 On average less than one package per month is delivered for every                 person in China.                       Without  the  low-cost  delivery  that  the  courier  services  provide,                  Alibaba would not be the giant it is today. To survive in a cutthroat                 industry, some of the courier firms have adopted clever methods to                 keep costs at rock bottom. In Shanghai, for instance, couriers shuttle                 back and forth on the subway, passing packages over the barriers to                 one another to avoid buying multiple tickets.                       But none of these couriers are employed by Alibaba itself. Most                 of the packages in China are delivered by private couriers. Where for-                 profit  delivery  services  have  yet  to  be  rolled  out,  mostly  in  the                 countryside, China Post handles the rest.","In  2005,  Alibaba  approached  China  Post,  proposing  to  work                 together  on  e-commerce.  But,  chief  strategy  officer  Zeng  Ming                 recalled, Jack “was laughed at. They actually told him to stick to his                 own  business.  They  didn’t  believe  in  express  delivery.”  China’s                  courier  companies  saw  the  same  opportunities  that  prompted                 companies like Wells Fargo to launch their own private parcel delivery                 and  banking  services  during  the  California  Gold  Rush  in  the  mid-                 nineteenth century, in response to the inefficiency of what was then                 the  United  States  Post  Office.  In  China,  the  e-commerce  gold  rush                 has  stimulated  the rise  of more  than  eight  thousand  private  courier                 firms, of which twenty major companies stand out.                       Alibaba’s  home  province  of  Zhejiang  is  home  also  to  most  of                  China’s  largest  courier  companies.  They  play  a  critical  role  in                 delivering  goods  all  over  the  country.  Over  half  of  the  package                 delivery market in China is carried out by just four companies, known                 as the “Three Tongs, One Da”: Shentong (STO Express), Yuantong                 (YTO Express), Zhongtong (ZTO Express), and Yunda. Remarkably                 all come from the same town, Tonglu, not far from Hangzhou. More                 than  two-thirds  of  their  business  comes  from  Taobao  and  Tmall.                  Together  with  two  other  smaller  delivery  companies  they  are  often                 referred to as the “Tonglu Gang.”                       The  Tonglu  Gang  along  with  a  company  called  SF  Express                    21                 have  played  a  major  role  in  Taobao’s  success.  ZTO  cofounder  Lai                 Jianfa  described  the  relationship:  “Delivery  companies  are  a                 propeller.  We  are  the  strongest  force  driving  Alibaba’s  fast                  development.”                       Alibaba has invested together with these companies and others                                                                                      22                 in a firm called China Smart Logistics, or “Cainiao.”  The combined                 hauling power of the fifteen logistics partners in Cainiao is staggering.                 Together  they  handle  more  than  30  million  packages  a  day  and                  employ  more  than  1.5  million  people  across  six  hundred  cities.                  23                 Cainiao is building a propriety information platform that knits together                 logistics  providers,  warehouses,  and  distribution  centers  across  the                 country.  Alibaba  owns  48  percent  of  Cainiao,  which,  with  the                 involvement of the Tonglu Gang and other self-made billionaires from                                                                                                    24                 the province, gives the company a distinctively Zhejiang flavor.  The                                                                       25                 Zhejiang-born  billionaire  Shen  Guojun   is  a  major  investor  in","Cainiao,  and  served  as  its  inaugural  CEO.  Fosun,  best  known                 overseas for its purchase of Club Med, is a 10 percent shareholder.                 Fosun’s chairman, Guo Guangchang, is also a native of Zhejiang. In                 December 2015, Guo was apparently detained for questioning by the                  Chinese authorities before being released several days later with no                 explanation, causing a sharp decline in Fosun’s share price.                       When  it  was  launched  in  2013,  Cainiao  announced  plans  to                 invest  more  than  $16  billion  by  2020  to  develop  the  “China  Smart                 Logistics  Network,”  comprising  three  networks—Peoplenet,                             26                                27                 Groundnet,   and  Skynet.  Cainiao  has  not  merged  the  courier                 companies,  instead  its  strategy  is  to  integrate  the  data  that  each                 generates—focusing  on  data  packets,  not  physical  packages.  The                 idea is that by sharing orders, delivery status, and customer feedback                 each  member  company  can  improve  efficiency  and  service  quality,                 while remaining separately owned.                        By investing in Cainiao, Alibaba aims to lock in vital relationships                 with its logistics partners while finding outside investors to fund the                 expansion  of  the  networks  themselves.  Cainiao  neither  owns  the                 physical  infrastructure  of  the  networks  nor  employs  the  personnel                 who  make  the  deliveries.  Those  assets  are  contributed  by  the                 consortium’s  members  and  partners,  allowing  Alibaba  to  pursue  an                 “asset-light” strategy.                       A lot is riding on this approach. Alibaba’s principal e-commerce                                             28                 competitor, JD.com,  is pursuing an “asset-heavy” strategy, investing                 directly in its own logistics infrastructure. JD’s mascot is Joy, a gray                 metallic dog, chosen no doubt to give symbolic chase to Tmall’s black                                                                                                 29                 cat. Today JD has built up the largest warehousing capacity  of any                 e-commerce  company  in  China,  offering  speedy  delivery  services                                           30                 including same-day  delivery in forty-three cities. JD.com runs a truly                 end-to-end  system,  controlling  its  own  procurement,  inventory,                 distribution,  and  warehouse  systems,  with  goods  delivered  to                 customers by uniformed couriers riding JD-branded vehicles.                        With  annual  revenues  topping  $11  billion,  JD  has  a  growing                 share  of  the  consumer  e-commerce  market.  The  company  is                 especially  strong  in  tier-one  cities  like  Beijing  and  in  product                 categories such as home appliances and electronics.","Alibaba’s  investment  in  the  electronics  retailer  Suning,  which  it                 watches warily, illustrates its concern. Both Alibaba and JD are vying                 to ensure deliveries in as little as two to three hours in a number of                 cities.                        Alibaba is attempting to build a whole a new competitive playing                 field by harnessing data technology, including Big Data—the ability to                 analyze  and  drive  business  decisions  from  the  huge  volumes  of                 information generated every day on its websites. On Singles’ Day, the                 delivery  paths  of  most  of  the  courier  companies  within  the  Cainiao                 network  were  analyzed  and  rerouted  in  the  event  of  traffic  jams.                 Alibaba  justifies  its  investment  in  Cainiao  by  arguing  that  demand                 would otherwise have run ahead of the courier companies’ ability to                  deliver the packages. This is borne out by feedback from merchants                 selling major appliances, such as refrigerators, during Singles’ Day in                 2015 who reported that less than 2 percent of the shipments handled                 by Cainiao arrived late or were damaged, compared to 15 percent of                 the  shipments  handled  by  other  courier  companies.  From  some  30                 million packages on a typical day at present, Alibaba expects it will                 generate more than 100 million packages of orders a day by 2020.                        An estimated 30 percent of current delivery routes are inefficient                 or uneconomic. Like Amazon in the United States, Cainiao member                 companies  are  experimenting  with  deliveries  by  drone  aircraft—                 although  higher  population  density  in  China,  especially  in  coastal                 areas, means this is not as big a priority as in the United States. In                 2015, YTO, one of the Tonglu Gang companies, ran a three-day trial                 involving  deliveries  of  ginger  tea  by  drone  to  a  few  hundred                 customers within one hour’s flight of Alibaba’s distribution centers in                  Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. For now drones in China remain                 just a gimmick. Innovations in logistics—such as shaving off delivery                 times  or  cutting  costs—are  likely  to  be  more  incremental  than                 revolutionary.                       Yet with Cainiao Alibaba has shored up the most important asset                 of all: trust. Customers and merchants know they can count on the                 products getting where they need to be, on time.                     The Finance Edge","The  final  edge  in  the  iron  triangle  is  finance.  In  financial  services,                 Alibaba’s most important asset is Alipay, its answer to PayPal. By far                 the most popular online payment tool in China, Alipay handles more                  than three-quarters of a trillion dollars a year in online transactions,                 31                 three  times  the  volume  of  PayPal  and  one-third  of  the  $2.5  trillion                 global online payments market. In the peak early minutes of Singles’                 Day  2015,  Alipay  handled  over  eighty-five  thousand  payments  per                 second.                       As a form of escrow, Alipay diffuses trust throughout Alibaba’s e-                 commerce empire. Consumers know that when they pay with Alipay                  their accounts will be debited only when they have received and are                 satisfied  with  the  products  they  have  ordered.  Only  then,  after                 freezing the amount on the account, will Alipay release the funds to                 the  merchant.  Customers  buying  on  Alibaba’s  consumer  sites  can                 return goods up to seven days after purchase, provided they are not                 damaged.                                                               32                       No  longer  owned  by Alibaba,   Alipay  is  the  largest  asset  of  a                 company,  controlled  personally  by  Jack,  which  has  been  valued  by                 one  analyst  at  $45  billion.  Alibaba  websites  account  for  more  than                 one-third of its revenues, but other sites also rely heavily on Alipay to                 process  their  online  payments.  People  use  Alipay  to  make  money                 transfers,  top  up  their  cell  phone  accounts,  and  make  cashless                 purchases  using  bar  codes  at  retailers  and  restaurants,  like  KFC.                  Twenty  percent  of all  Alipay  transactions  involve  paying  for utilities,                 such as water, electricity, and gas bills. Customers can also buy train                 tickets, pay traffic fines, or purchase insurance using Alipay, making it                 the  de  facto  currency  of  an  increasingly  digital  China.  Thanks  to                 commissions on payments it handles, Alipay, which is already highly                 profitable,  is  expected  to  generate  almost  $5  billion  a  year  in                              33                 revenues  by 2018.                       With the growth of smartphones in China, used by more than 830                 million people, the value of Alipay goes far beyond that of a simple                 payment  tool.  Because  consumers  keep  cash  balances  on  their                 accounts,  Alipay  has  become  a  virtual  wallet  for  over  300  million                 people, the thin end of a wedge that Alibaba is driving into China’s                 financial services market.","In the same way Alibaba has exploited the inefficiency of offline                 retail,  offline  banking  has  proved  a  ripe  fruit  for  it  to  pick.  Just  as                 state-owned  shops  paid  little  interest  in  their  customers,  China’s                 state-owned  banks  paid  little  heed  to  the  needs  of  individuals  and                  small businesses. Until recently, they had no choice but to place their                 cash  deposits  with  the  banks  that  were  focused  on  state-owned                 enterprises. The political masters of the SOEs are also their own.                       The  “big  four”  state-owned  banks—the  Industrial  and                 Commercial  Bank  of  China  (ICBC),  Construction  Bank,  Bank  of                 China, and Agricultural Bank of China—control about 70 percent of                 the market. The disdain of these banks for their customers has fueled                 popular jokes such as the one about ICBC’s initials standing for, in                  Chinese,  “ai  cun  bu  cun,”  translating  loosely  as  “who  cares  if  you                 save  with  us or not, whatever.” Traditionally, these  and  other  state-                 owned banks paid out very low rates of interest, at times below the                 rate  of  inflation.  This  “financial  repression”  has  skewed  China’s                 economy,  transferring  wealth  from  consumers  to  the  SOEs,  which                 have  squandered  much  of  it  in  the  loss-making  investments  of  the                 Old China model.                        The  Chinese  government  recognizes  the  need  for  reform,  and                 the need  for  more  rational  capital  allocation.  But  to  do  so  it  has  to                 take on a powerful vested interest: itself. Alibaba has already been                 caught in the middle. Offering much higher returns on deposits than                 the  meager  returns  paid  by  the  banks,  Alibaba’s  Yu’e  Bao  online                 mutual fund proved so popular when it launched in 2013 that it stirred                 China’s  stagnant  financial  service  industry  into  a  frenzy  of  activity.                 Yu’e  Bao,  whose  name  translates  in  English  as  “savings  balance                  treasure,”  sounds  innocuous  enough:  a place  to deposit  your  loose                 change. But when it launched the product Alibaba set no limits on the                 amount customers could deposit. Not only were the rates it offered                 much  higher  than  the  banks—as  much  as  two  percentage  points                 higher—but Yu’e Bao allowed customers to make withdrawals at any                 time  without  penalty.  As  a  result,  individual  customers  transferred                 tens  or  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  into  the  fund.  The  banks                                                                                                     34                 became alarmed at the outflows. By February 2014, Yu’e Bao  had                 attracted  over  $93  billion  from  80  million  investors,  more  than  the                 combined total accounts of all other money managers in China. The","inflow was so huge that in only ten months Yu’e Bao was ranked the                 fourth  largest  money  manager  in  the  world,  closing  in  on  global                 industry stalwarts such as Vanguard, Fidelity, and J.P. Morgan.                       Prior  to  the  fund’s  launch  Jack  took  the  unusual  step,  for  a                  private  sector  entrepreneur,  of  penning  an  opinion  piece  in  the                 Communist  Party  journal  People’s  Daily  arguing,  “The  finance                 industry needs disrupters, it needs outsiders to come in and carry out                 a  transformation.”  Soon  after,  the  SOE  empire  struck  back,                 denouncing  the  fund  managers  behind  Yu’e  Bao  as  “vampires                 sucking  blood  out  of  the  banks.”  Starting  in  March  2014,  the  state-                 owned banks, holding collectively more than $100 trillion in deposits,                 imposed  limits  on  the  amounts  their  customers  could  transfer  into                  third-party  online  payment  accounts.  Other  government-imposed                 restrictions  followed  soon  after.  Pulling  no  punches,  Jack  posted  a                 message on social media criticizing the banks by name and blaming                 them  for  failing  to  participate  in  China’s  market-oriented  financial                 liberalization: “The decision of who wins and who loses in the market                 shouldn’t be up to monopoly and authority, but up to customers.” Jack                 deleted it soon after, but the message was reposted widely. Alibaba                  has continued to push the boundaries of private sector involvement in                 financial  services,  including  providing  microloans  to  the  merchants                 and  consumers  trading  on  its  platforms.  Still  relatively  new,  the                 lending  business  is  expected  to  grow  into  a  billion-dollar  business                 within a few years. Offering credit also increases the “stickiness,” or                 loyalty from customers, of Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms.                       Because  it  has  access  to  the  entire  trading  history  of  its                 customers, Alibaba is in a much better position to assess credit risk                  than  the  banks.  A  new  business,  Sesame  Credit  Management,                 provides credit ratings on consumers and merchants to third parties.                                                                   35                       Other financial services offerings  include wealth management,                                                                                     36                 peer-to-peer  lending  businesses,  and  insurance.   In  2015  Jack                 launched an Internet-only bank called MYbank, which gets rid of the                 need  for  branches  entirely.  MYbank  plans  to  use  smartphones  to                 authenticate customers’ identities.          37                       The  iron  triangle  is  a  key  factor  in  making  Alibaba  such  a                 dominant player in China’s e-commerce market. But it is the charisma","of the company’s founder—his “Jack Magic”—that bound together the                 people and capital who would build on these foundations.","Chapter Two                                                    Jack Magic                              Come up with an idea, make it fun, and breathe something into it                            which otherwise is still just an idea. That’s Jack Magic.                                                   —Jan Van der Ven                     Most companies bear the imprint of their founders, but few more than                 Alibaba.  Jack  Ma’s  outsize  influence  stems  from  his  passion  for                  teaching. Although he left the profession two decades ago, Jack has                 never really stopped being an educator. He used to joke that in his                 case  CEO  stood  for  “Chief  Education  Officer.”  Fourteen  years  after                 founding  the  company  Jack  relinquished  the  title  to  become                 chairman.  But  the  switch  served  only  to  heighten  his  authority.  His                 chosen successor as CEO lasted barely two years in the job.                     E.T.                  Jack is, without doubt, the face of Alibaba. Short and thin, Jack has                 been described in the media over the years as an “imp of a man,” “a                 tiny figure with sunken cheekbones, tussled hair and a mischievous                  grin,”  his  looks  “owlish,”  “puckish,”  or  “elfish.”  Jack  has  turned  his                 distinctive  looks  to  his  advantage.  At  the  launch  of  MYbank,  which                 aims  to  sign  up  customers  exclusively  through  facial  recognition                 technology,  Alibaba  showcased  the  fact  that  Jack  “who  had  been                 unable to live off his face was now going to live off his face.”                       Some in China like to refer to Jack as “E.T.,” after a supposed                 resemblance  to  the  lead  creature  in  the  Steven  Spielberg  movie.                                                                                                      1                 Even  his  Zhejiang-born  billionaire  friend  Guo  Guangchang   has","called Jack an “alien,” but only before dismissing himself as “just a                 normal guy . . . no one is as smart as Jack Ma.”                       So,  Jack  doesn’t  look  the  part  of  a  corporate  chieftain.  He                 possesses all the trappings, including luxury homes around the world                  and a Gulfstream jet, but otherwise Jack doesn’t really act the part,                 either. One of the most circulated images of Jack on the Internet is a                 photo of him sporting a Mohawk, nose ring, and makeup, including                 jet-black  lipstick.  On  that  occasion,  a  celebration  of  Alibaba’s  tenth                 anniversary, Jack sang Elton John’s “Can You Feel the Love Tonight”                 to a stadium full of seventeen thousand cheering employees and ten                 thousand other spectators.                       Jack combines a love of showmanship with a relish for defying                  stereotypes.  Where  other  business  moguls  like  to  talk  up  their                 connections  or  academic  credentials,  Jack  enjoys  talking  down  his                 own:  “I  don’t  have  a  rich  or  powerful  father,  not  even  a  powerful                 uncle.” Having never studied abroad, he likes to describe himself as                 “one  hundred  percent  Made  in  China.”  He  stands  out  as  a  tech                 company  founder  with  no  background  in  technology.  At  Stanford                 University in 2013 he confessed, “Even today, I still don’t understand                  what coding is all about, I still don’t understand the technology behind                 the Internet.”                       Jack  has  made  a  career  out  of  being  underestimated:  “I  am  a                 very simple guy, I am not smart. Everyone thinks that Jack Ma is a                 very  smart  guy.  I  might  have  a  smart  face  but  I’ve  got  very  stupid                 brains.”                     Blarney Meets Chutzpah in China                  His  achievements  have  proved  otherwise—this  dumbing  down  is of                                                                          2                 course  just  a  feint.  Jack  once  explained   that  he  loves  the  lead                 character  of  the  movie  Forrest  Gump  because  “people  think  he  is                 dumb,  but  he  knows  what  he  is  doing.”  In  his  early  speeches                 promoting  Alibaba,  Jack  referred  so  often  to  Forrest  Gump  that  I                 came to think of his stump speech as his “Gump speech.” Much has                 changed for Alibaba, but Gump’s appeal endures. On the first day of                 trading  of Alibaba’s shares,  Jack was  interviewed  by CNBC  live  on                 the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. When he was asked which","person  had  most  inspired  him,  Jack  replied  without  hesitation,                 “Forrest Gump.” His interviewer paused, then said, “You know he’s a                 fictional character?”                       Jack’s ability to charm and cajole has played an important role in                  attracting  talent  and  capital  to the company, as well  as building  his                 own  fame.  Jack  has  a  unique  Chinese  combination  of  blarney  and                                                                                 3                 chutzpah. One of his earliest foreign employees  summed up for me                 his qualities in two words: “Jack Magic.” In this respect, Jack shares a                 characteristic with Steve Jobs, whose charisma and means of getting                 his way were famously described by a member of the original Apple                  Macintosh design team as a “Reality Distortion Field.”                       Central  to  Jack’s  own  distortion  field  are  his  skills  as  a                 communicator.  Jack’s  speaking  style  is  so  effective  because  his                 message is so easy to agree with, remember, and digest. Collections                 of his quotes circulate widely online, in English as well as in Chinese.                 Most are bite-size messages of inspiration, words that wouldn’t be out                 of place on a motivational poster, such as “Believe in your dream and                  believe in yourself,” or “Learn from others the tactics and the skills,                 but don’t change your dream.” Other popular quotes read more like                 an Aesop fable: “If there are nine rabbits on the ground, if you want to                 catch one, just focus on one. Change your tactics if you need to, but                 don’t change the rabbit. . . . Get one first, put it in your pocket, and                 then  catch  the  others.”  People  have  even  taken  to  inventing  carpe                 diem–style quotes from Jack to justify, for example, the purchase of a                 pair of expensive shoes.                        Jack  always  speaks  without  notes.  His  oratorical  skills  are  so                 effective because his repertoire is so narrow. Jack can dispense with                 notes because he already knows much of his material: a well-honed                 stable  of  stock  stories,  mostly  tales  from  his  childhood  or  Alibaba’s                 own infancy. A close inspection of all of his speeches reveals he has                 essentially been giving the same speech for the last seventeen years.                 Yet  by  subtly  tweaking  his  message  to  match  the  mood  and                  expectations  of  the  crowd,  he  somehow  manages  to  make  each                 speech sound fresh.                       Jack is a master at appealing to people’s emotions, which is not                 something you’d expect from the founder of a company that started                 out focusing on international trade. Sometimes, as he’s launched into","a  familiar  story,  I  have  turned  around  to  look  at  the  faces  of  the                 audience, trying to understand what explains his enduring appeal.                       Humor is a big part of it. As a quick look at any of the hundreds                 of  videos  available  on  YouTube  of  his  most  popular  speeches  will                  reveal,  Jack  is  very  funny.  Back  in  the  early  days,  after  he  came                 offstage at an event we’d both spoken at, I joked to him that if his day                 job at Alibaba didn’t work out he had a promising career as a stand-                                   4                 up comedian.  Jack’s set pieces, his one-liners and anecdotes, and                 the way he combines them are essentially the same as the “bits” that                 comedians use to make up their routines.                        With  his  tales  of  overcoming  challenges  and  defying  the  odds,                 Jack regularly drives some in his audience to tears, even hardened                 business  executives.  After  giving  a  talk  to  a  group  of  students  in                 South  Korea,  Jack  himself  appeared  to  be  consumed  by  emotion                 when asked about his biggest regrets in life, replying that he regretted                 not spending more time with his family. After composing himself, he                 added, “Normally I make other people cry.”                        Jack’s  speeches,  like  that  one  in  Seoul,  reach  a  much  wider                 audience  than  speeches  by  many  public  figures  in  China  in  part                 because  he  is  able  to  deliver  them  in  fluent  English.  Other  tech                 executives in China speak English, too, many having been educated                 overseas, but Jack’s message has much greater resonance in both                 languages.  Jack’s  long-term  business  partner,  Joe  Tsai,  told  me:                 “Jack today is still one of the only international businesspeople who is                 as attention-grabbing in both English and Chinese.”                        To build a connection to foreign audiences, Jack often peppers                 his  speeches  with  pop-culture  references—including  citing  more                 recent  movies  than  Forrest  Gump,  some  of  which  Alibaba  is  now                 financing. As his company expands its presence in Hollywood, Jack                 now regularly enlists the support at his public appearances of famous                 actors like Daniel Craig, Kevin Spacey, and Tom Cruise, the star of                 Paramount Pictures’ Mission: Impossible franchise—in 2015 Alibaba                  invested in Rogue Nation, the franchise’s latest title. To audiences in                 China,  Jack  often  draws  on  stories  from  his  favorite  martial  arts                 novels, or Chinese revolutionary history. An American colleague once                 asked  Jack  about  his  references  to  Mao  in  his  speeches  in  China.","Jack explained, “For me to motivate you I would talk about George                 Washington and the cherry tree.”                     Jack’s Mantra                  Perhaps  the  most  famous  lesson  of  Jack  the  teacher  is  known  by                 heart  by  every  Alibaba  employee:  “Customers  first,  employees                 second,  and  shareholders  third.”  Jack  describes  this  as  Alibaba’s                 philosophy.                        Customers,  especially  the  “shrimp,”  come  first  in  his  mantra.                 When asked by the journalist Charlie Rose if he saw himself as an                 “apostle for small business,” Jack agreed, “I’m a strong believer. It’s                 my religion.” Many small businesses in China don’t just use Alibaba’s                 websites  as  a  marketing  channel,  they  depend  entirely  on  them  to                 make a living. Jack has always insisted on offering most of Alibaba’s                  services for free.                       Employees  may  come  second  to  customers  for  Jack,  but  an                 ability to motivate his team to overcome obstacles has been critical to                 Alibaba’s success. Joe Tsai didn’t hesitate in describing them to me                 as “disciples,” when recalling his first impression in 1999 of Alibaba’s                 earliest  employees,  some  of  whom  had  already  followed  Jack  for                 years. Jack doesn’t sugar coat the challenges to his employees. One                 of his favorite messages to them, and a “bit” in his comedy routine, is                 “Today is brutal, tomorrow is more brutal, but the day after tomorrow                  is beautiful. However, the majority of people will die tomorrow night.”                 The  goal  for  Alibaba  to  survive  for  102  years  might  seem  weird  to                 outsiders  but  not  to  his  employees,  especially  the  Aliren  (the  “Ali                 People”)—those with more than three years of service—for whom it is                 an accepted part of the Alibaba culture.                       Shareholders come third in Jack’s ranking because he refuses to                 be  diverted  from  his  lofty  ambitions  by  short-term  pressures  to                  generate profit. In public, Jack likes to make fun of his shareholders                 and investors, a means to burnish his credentials as a maverick with                 his  employees  and  the  general  public.  When  the  share  price  of                 Alibaba’s first business, alibaba.com, languished on the stock market                 in  2009,  Jack  cried  out  at  the  rock  concert–style  gathering  for  the                 company’s employees, “Let the Wall Street investors curse us if they","wish!”  Not  exactly  standard  behavior  for  the  senior  executive  of  a                 publicly listed company.                       Yet  despite  the  populist  rhetoric,  Jack  has  assiduously  created                 opportunities at regular intervals—on average every four years or so                  —for employees and long-term shareholders to turn a profit from the                 sale  of  their  shares.  Investors  who  supported  Alibaba  early  on  and                 stuck with the company for years have been richly rewarded, much                 less so those public investors who purchased the company’s shares                 in their post-IPO peak.                     Company Campus and Culture                  Jack’s imprint can also be seen in the design of Alibaba’s 2.6-million-                 square-foot  Wetlands  headquarters  campus.  From  the  main  south                 gate visitors enter a massive complex of futuristic glass towers. At the                  base of the office towers lie a large gym, Starbucks, and a country-                 style  store  stocked  with  organic  fruit  and  vegetables  that  could  be                 straight out of Silicon Valley. Farther to the north lies a huge, man-                 made lake. Dotted with lotuses and lily pads and bordered with reeds,                 the  lake  is  overlooked  on  one  side  by  a  cluster  of  elegant,  white-                 walled  villas  topped  with  curved,  black-tiled  roofs,  a  scene                 reminiscent of Jack’s much-loved classical novels, like the sixteenth-                 century work The Water Margin.                       The  lake  reflects  Jack’s  newfound  passion  for  environmental                  protection. When asked by President Obama in Manila what spurred                 his interest in the environment, Jack told the story of a lake in which                 he had last swam when he was twelve years old. “I went to swim in a                 lake  and  almost  died  in  the  lake  because  the  water  was  so  deep,                 much deeper than I thought. Five years ago I went to the lake, the                 total lake was dry.”                       On  a  visit  in  the  spring  of  2015  to  the  campus,  I  had  to  step                  gingerly to avoid squashing the tiny baby frogs that had hopped out of                 the man-made lake onto the walkway leading to the office towers. On                 my way I also stopped by Alibaba’s large library and bookstore. Jack                 is a keen reader, particularly of titles by the Hong Kong–born martial                 arts writer (Louis) Cha Leung-yung, known in China by his pen name                 Jin  Yong.  His  works  are  featured  in  the  library  along  with  classical","works and the latest books on management theory or Silicon Valley                 icons like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.                       But  beyond  the  design  of  the  campus,  it  is  in  the  culture  of                 Alibaba  that  we  can  most  clearly  see  the  influence  of  its  principal                  founder. To zip around the Wetlands headquarters complex, Alibaba’s                 employees  make  frequent  use  of  the  free  bicycles  the  company                 provides, a perk no doubt inspired by Google’s fleet, which is decked                 out in the U.S. giant’s signature blue, yellow, green, and red colors.                 The  bicycles  at  Alibaba  are  orange  and  include  tandems:  the  two                 seats  illustrating  the  company’s  emphasis  on  teamwork  above                 individual achievement.                       A sense of subjugating one’s own needs for the interest of the                  customer  is  a  cornerstone  of  Alibaba’s  corporate  culture.  Just  as                 Disney  refers  to  all  of  its  executives  and  employees  as  “cast                 members,”  Alibaba  places  a  big  emphasis  on  camaraderie  and  a                 commitment to the greater good.                       Every May 10, around the time of the annual “Aliday,” a company                 anniversary  that  celebrates  the  spirit  of  teamwork  shown  by  the                 company’s employees as they emerged from the spectre of the SARS                  virus, Jack presides  as chief  witness  over  a ceremony  to celebrate                 recent weddings of company employees. Alibaba covers the lodging                 and meal expenses of the immediate family members who are invited                 to  join.  The  photos  of  a  hundred  plus  couples  celebrating  their                 matrimonials  together  at  one  company  has  inevitably  invited                 comparisons  to  cults  such  as  Rev.  Sun  Myung  Moon’s  Unification                 Church. But Alibaba takes pains to point out that the event is just a                 celebration,  not  a  replacement,  of  the  couples’  official  marriage                  registrations.                       A  more  tangible  benefit  for  the  couples  and  other  Alibaba                 employees is the interest-free loan of up to $50,000 offered to finance                 the down payment on a new apartment, an increasingly valued perk                 for  staff  members  working  in  high-cost  cities  like  Hangzhou  and                 Beijing. Thousands of employees have taken advantage of the loans,                 amounting to several hundred millions dollars today.                        Alibaba  encourages  a  sense  of  informality  at  work.  Every                 employee  is  asked  to  adopt  a  nickname.  The  practice  is  so                 widespread that it can invite confusion when they have to search to","find  out  the  actual  names  of  their  colleagues  to  communicate  to                 people outside the company. Initially, the nicknames were drawn from                 characters  in  the  novels  of  Jin  Yong  or  other  stories  of  martial  arts                 and  bygone  eras.  As  Alibaba  grew  this  pool  of  names  was  soon                  exhausted. Using their nicknames, employees post comments about                 the company’s products or culture on Aliway, the company’s internal                 bulletin  board.  They  can  even  initiate  polls  or  invite  the  support  of                 their  colleagues  to  dispute  assessments  or  management  decisions,                 and  address  suggestions  or  complaints  directly  to  Feng  Qingyang.                 That is the name of Jack’s online persona, a swordsman from one of                 his favorite martial arts novels.                       Employees are discouraged from ever complaining—a pet peeve                  of  Jack’s—and  encouraged  instead  to  shoulder  personal                 responsibility, carrying out or delegating tasks rather than waiting for                 orders from on high.                       Military terms crop up a lot at Alibaba. Top-performing individuals                 at  Alibaba  are  known  as  King  of  Soldiers  (bing  wang).  Fictional                 character Xu Sanduo is sometimes used to illustrate management’s                 message.  In the 2007  TV drama  Soldier’s Sortie,  Xu,  a  shy  village                  boy, rises despite the odds to become an elite soldier in the People’s                 Liberation Army.                     Six Vein Spirit Sword                  Alibaba has codified its own company values in something it calls the                 Six  Vein  Spirit  Sword.  The  term  originates  in  the  work  of  Jack’s                 favorite novelist, Jin Yong. The sword he writes about is not an actual                 weapon,  but  the  art  of  building  up  one’s  own  internal  strengths  in                 order  to  defeat  any  opponent.  In  Alibaba’s  case,  the  strengths  that                 form  the  Six  Vein  Spirit  Sword  are  akin  to  those  outlined  in  the                 “Mission, Vision, and Values” of Jack’s favorite corporate guru, Jack                  Welch, the former CEO of General Electric (GE).                       Welch’s 2005 book, Winning, recommends an almost messianic                 culture in the workplace: “Leaders make sure people not only see the                 vision, they live and breathe it.” Jack (Ma) has always held GE in high                 regard.","The  “Six  Veins”  of  Alibaba’s  “Spirit  Sword”  are  “customer  first,                 teamwork,  embrace  change,  integrity,  passion,  and  commitment.”                 Generic-sounding  as  they  are,  the  company  treats  them  very                 seriously. Commitment to the Six Vein Spirit Sword accounts for half                  of employee appraisals.                       “Customer first” is reflected in the power given to Taobao’s xiaoer                 referees  and  in  the  composition  of  Alibaba’s  workforce.  Most  of                 Alibaba employees work in sales, a much higher proportion than the                 more technical bent of competitors like Tencent and Baidu. Face-to-                 face visits are a key part of Alibaba’s sales methods.               5                        “Teamwork” at Alibaba means regular group games, songs, and                 outings.  These  can  come  as  quite  a  culture  shock  to  employees                 joining Alibaba from firms based in Silicon Valley. But for those fresh                 out  of  college,  the  system  of  apprentices  and  mentors  is  well                 received, including the routine of holding regular meetings to “kick off                 in  the  morning  and  share  in  the  evening.”  One  former  employee                 summed it up: “Lots of companies focus only on results: You have to                  complete  a  certain  number  of  orders.  Alibaba  takes  the  opposite                 approach:  If  you  want  to  complete  a  certain  number  of  orders  this                 month, what do you need to do every day? By breaking it down into                 phases, each day could be dedicated to one key step in the process                 —and eventually you wouldn’t be far off from your goal.” Recognition                 of  high  performers  in  company-wide  announcements  helps,  too,  as                 do the prizes awarded to the “A-teams” (lao A, a military reference),                 ranging from Louis Vuitton wallets, belts, and limited-edition sneakers                  to monthly bonuses of tens of thousands of yuan or even a car.                       The  call  to  “embrace  change”  is  reflected  in  Alibaba’s  frequent                 rotation  of its employees,  switching  them regularly  between  various                 new  products  or  between  regions  of  the  country,  regardless  of                 performance.  This  creates  lots  of  challenges,  but  Alibaba  asks  its                 employees to “embrace setbacks,” a radical departure from traditional                 Chinese  culture,  where  failure  is  seen  as  something  shameful.                  Alibaba’s  approach  is  in  line  with  the  Silicon  Valley  practice  of                 entrepreneurs celebrating previous failed ventures on their T-shirts, a                 recognition that on the fast-moving battle lines of the China Internet,                 some failure is unavoidable, or even desirable.","The “integrity” vein of the sword highlights the fact that corruption                 is  a  constant  risk  for  Alibaba:  Millions  of  merchants  are  constantly                 looking for ways to promote their wares on Taobao, overseen by only                 a  few  thousand  xiaoer  referees.  The  Communist  Party  of  China                  regularly  uses  rotation  of  personnel  to  avoid  alternative  centers  of                 power from developing, in an effort to keep corruption under control.                 David  Wei,  who  served  as  the  CEO  of  Alibaba.com,  experienced                 Jack’s penchant for rotation even before he had joined the company.                 In the nine months between leaving his previous employer and joining                 Alibaba, David recalled, “[m]y job description and titles changed four                 times before I joined. First I was going to be head of Taobao, then                 head of Alipay. I didn’t know what I was doing until one month before                  I  was  on  board.”  Once  he  finally  joined  as  CEO  of  Alibaba’s  B2B                 business, David joked to Jack, “You changed my job so many times                 before I joined you couldn’t change it anymore.”                       Whatever the inspiration for regular rotation, Alibaba devolves a                 lot of autonomy to its business units, an effort to maintain a relatively                 flat  management  hierarchy  and  minimize  the  temptation  to  shame                 and blame.                        The  need  to  demonstrate  “passion”  when  working  for  Alibaba                 was summed up by one employee as “being a swordsman is all about                 being hot-blooded.” Compared to other firms, “people at Alibaba are                 more  passionate  about  their  work,  more  honest,  and  more                 hardworking.”  Jack’s  emphasis  on  “commitment”  is  reflected  in  his                 frequent invocation of the phrase to “work happily but live seriously.”                 The  whimsical  approach  he  encourages  at  Alibaba  is,  he  says,  in                 stark contrast to most companies who emphasize “working seriously                  but living happily.”                       Measuring how employees live up to the Six Vein Spirit Sword is                 the  job  of  Alibaba’s  human  resources  department,  which  plays  a                 critical role, overseeing the hiring of twelve thousand people in one                 year alone. Relegated in some companies to a purely administrative                 function, HR at Alibaba has tremendous power over promotions and                 hiring. With its constant emphasis on culture and ideology, people at                  Alibaba  refer  to  HR  informally  as  the  “Political  Commissar”  (zheng                 wei).  The  HR  department  also  oversees  extensive  training,  with                 manuals of more than one thousand pages for new employees and a","sophisticated  database,  matching  performance  closely  with                 promotions and pay raises.                       The culture of Alibaba endures even in the employees who have                 left  the  company.  Given  the  long  history  and  rapid  growth  of  the                  company, they number over twenty-five thousand. Many have banded                 together  in  a  nonprofit  organization  called  the  Former  Orange  Club                 (qian cheng hui) to help its members share investment opportunities                 and career advice. One member, Hu Zhe, who left Alibaba in 2010                                                                             6                 after working  there  for five years, described  his  reason  for joining:                 “Former  Alibaba  employees  are  closely  connected,  as  if  there  is  a                  bond linking us together. The club serves as a very important platform                 for us to communicate and exchange ideas.”                                                         7                       A  number  of  members   have  founded  their  own  Internet                 companies or investment vehicles, some of which have established                 links  with  one  another,  active  in  a  range  of  sectors  including  e-                  commerce,  online  travel  booking,  Internet  financial  services,  online                 music,  online  recruiting,  O2O,  venture  capital,  and  health  care.  A                                              8                 search  in  a  database  of  Chinese  Internet-related  start-ups  reveals                 that former Alibaba employees have been associated with 317 start-                 ups, compared to 294 from Tencent and 223 from Baidu. While not all                 of  these  start-ups  will  be  successful,  indeed  some  of  them  have                  already failed, the web of entrepreneurial activity is important both as                 a source of future innovation and acquisition targets for Alibaba.                       A common thread in many of the ventures founded by Alibaba                 veterans is what some have described as a “Long March” culture, an                 ambitious  management  ethos  that  involves  personal  sacrifice,  and                 huge  investments  of  personnel  and  time.  In  contrast,  in  their  new                 businesses,  the  veterans  of  Alibaba’s  rivals  such  as  Tencent  are                  known  to  focus  more  on  reducing  “time  to  market,”  launching                 products  that  they  can  perfect  later,  an  approach  some  refer  to  as                 “running with short steps.”                       Alibaba  has  been  a  team  effort  from  the  start.  Jack  doled  out                 much more equity, and at an earlier stage, than many of his Internet                 founder peers. But he has kept a firm control on the company through                 his gift for communicating and his lofty ambitions. A modern-day Don                 Quixote,  Jack  relishes  tilting  at  windmills,  from  retail  to  finance,  to                  entertainment, health care, and beyond. To gain a sense of how likely","Alibaba is to conquer these new horizons, let’s look at the events that                 made Jack and the company what they are today.","Chapter Three                                    From Student to Teacher                               If you are one in a million in China, you’re one of 1,300 people.                                                       —Bill Gates                     Barrow Boy                  Jack Ma was born on September 10, 1964, the Year of the Dragon, in                  Hangzhou, a city one hundred miles to the southwest of Shanghai.                 His parents named him “Yun,” meaning “cloud.” His surname, “Ma,” is                 the same as the Chinese word for horse.                       Jack’s mother, Cui Wencai, worked on a factory production line.                 His  father,  Ma  Laifa,  worked  as  a  photographer  at  the  Hangzhou                 Photography Agency. But both share a passion for pingtan, a form of                 Chinese folk art performance that involves the singing of ballads and                 comedic  routines  punctuated  by  the  sound  of  wooden  clappers.                 Exposure  to  the  art  form  may  help  explain  Jack’s  abilities  as  a                  communicator. Pingtan no doubt provided Jack’s parents a welcome                 escape  from  the  hardscrabble  life  of  postrevolutionary  China,  a                 window to a richer and more colorful past.                       A  future  icon  of  Chinese  entrepreneurship,  Jack  came  into  the                 world at a time when private enterprise had almost been completely                 extinguished. Ninety percent of industrial production had been taken                  into the hands of the state. China was alone in the world, struggling to                 recover  from  the  Great  Leap  Forward.  Faced  with  the  starvation  of                 millions across the country, Mao Zedong had been forced to make a                 “self-criticism”  and  was  relegated  to  the  margins  of  power.  Deng                 Xiaoping was among those tasked with reversing the most damaging                 aspects  of  collectivization,  a  foreshadowing  of  the  pivotal  role  he","would play in unleashing the country’s economic miracle, which, two                 decades  later, would  provide  the opening  for Jack’s entrepreneurial                 career.                       But when Jack was two, Mao was back in power and China was                  subjected to the ravages of the Cultural Revolution. Mao launched an                 attack on the “Four Olds”—old customs, culture, habits, and ideas—                 and  Red  Guards  marched  to  destroy  cultural  sites  and  antiquities,                 including in Hangzhou, where they attacked and badly damaged the                 tomb of Yue Fei, a famous Song dynasty general. But even the Red                 Guards were not immune to the charms of the city, taking breaks from                 their violence with boat trips on West Lake. Mao himself developed a                 strong  attachment  to  Hangzhou,  visiting  it  on  more  than  forty                  occasions  and  staying  up  to  seven  months  at  a  time.  He  enjoyed                 performances of pingtan. Despite Mao’s fondness for the art form in                 private, old customs like pingtan became a target of the Red Guards                 and  its  practitioners  were  denounced.  Jack’s  family  was  at  risk  of                 persecution, particularly as his grandfather had been a local official                     1                  under  the  Nationalist  (KMT)  government.  During  the  Cultural                 Revolution Jack was taunted by his classmates, although fortunately                 the family was not broken up like many were at the time.                       In February 1972, President Nixon traveled to Hangzhou as part                 of his historic visit to China to meet Mao. Nixon was accompanied on                 the trip by almost one hundred reporters, including Walter Cronkite,                 Dan Rather, Ted Koppel, and Barbara Walters, their live broadcasts                 generating  support  for  the  normalization  of  relations  with  China,                  leading  eventually  to  cities  like  Hangzhou  reemerging  as  a                 destination for foreign tourists.                       As  a  boy,  Jack  fell  in  love  with  the  English  language  and                 literature,  particularly  readings  of  Mark  Twain’s  The  Adventures  of                 Tom Sawyer that he listened to on a shortwave radio. Later it was the                 arrival of foreign tourists in China that provided Jack with his opening                 to  the  outside  world.  In  late  1978,  when  Jack  was  fourteen,  China                  launched the new “open door” policy, initiated by Deng Xiaoping, in                 pursuit of foreign trade and investment. After a decade of turmoil the                 country  was  on  the  verge  of  bankruptcy,  and  desperately  needed                 hard currency.","In  1978,  only  728  foreign  tourists  visited  Hangzhou.  But  the                 following  year  more  than  forty  thousand  came  to  the  city.  Jack                 relished any opportunity to practice his English. He started waking up                 before dawn and riding his bicycle for forty minutes to the Hangzhou                  Hotel  to greet  foreign  tourists. As he  recalled,  “Every morning  from                 five o’clock I would read English in front of the hotel. A lot of foreign                 visitors came from the USA, from Europe. I’d give them a free tour of                 West  Lake,  and  they  taught  me  English.  For  nine  years!  And  I                 practiced my English every morning, no matter if it snowed or rained.”                       An  American  tourist  whose  father  and  husband  were  named                 Jack  suggested  the  name  and  Ma  Yun  became  known  in  English                 henceforth as Jack. He is dismissive of the quality of his English: “I                  just  make  myself  understood.  The  grammar  is  terrible.”  But  Jack                 never dismisses how much learning the language has helped him in                 life: “English helps me a lot. It makes me understand the world better,                 helps me to meet the best CEOs and leaders in the world, and makes                 me understand the distance between China and the world.”                       Among the many tourists who came to Hangzhou in 1980 was an                 Australian family, the Morleys. Ken Morley, a recently retired electrical                  engineer,  had  signed  up  for  a  tour  of  China  offered  by  the  local                 branch of the Australia China Friendship Society. He took along his                 wife, Judy, and their three children, David, Stephen, and Susan, for                 whom it would be their first overseas trip. For Jack, their visit would                 change his life.                       Today, David runs a yoga studio in Australia, where I managed to                 track him down. He kindly shared his memories and the photos of his                 family’s visit to China and their enduring friendship with Jack.                        On  July  1,  1980,  the  Morleys’  Australian  tour  group  arrived  by                 plane  in  Hangzhou  from  Beijing  and  was  transferred  by  bus  to  the                 Shangri-La Hotel on West Lake, the same hotel (then the Hangzhou                 Hotel)  where  President  Nixon  and  his  entourage  had  stayed  eight                 years  earlier.  David  recalls  being  shown  the  suite  where  the  First                 Couple  had  stayed,  allocated  to  their  tour  leader,  complete  with                 “plush,  red  velvet  toilet  seats,  which  we  three  children  were                  fascinated by.”                       The next day the Australian group’s itinerary included a boat trip                 on West Lake, followed by a visit to the nearby tea plantations and on","to the Liuhe (Six Harmonies) Pagoda before returning to the hotel for                 dinner at 6:30 P.M. Taking advantage of the “free evening,” David and                 a  young  woman  called  Keva  whom  he  had  befriended  on  the  trip                 snuck  across  the  road  from  the  hotel  to  the  park  opposite,                  overlooking West Lake. There they proceeded to play with matches,                 practicing  the  art  of  “match  flicking”  that  she  had  taught  him.  This                 involved standing a match upside-down with its head on the striking                 surface and flicking it with your fingers and watching it spiral off to,                 David  recalls,  “hopefully  an  uneventful  extinguishment.”  Fortunately                 that day, the park didn’t catch fire. But David and Keva’s antics did                 catch the attention of a fifteen-year-old boy—Jack Ma.                       David recalls, “It was on that free evening, flicking matches in the                  park, that I was approached by a young man wanting to try his newly                 acquired  English  skills  on  me.  He  introduced  himself;  we  swapped                 pleasantries and agreed to meet in the park again.”                       On July 4, their last day in Hangzhou, David introduced Jack to                 his  sister,  Susan,  and  invited  him  and  some  other  local  children  to                 play Frisbee with them in the park. David described the scene to me:                 Marking out a playing area with shoes and other items “we were soon                  surrounded  by  hundreds  of  Chinese  spectators.”  Jack’s  father,  Ma                 Laifa, took photos of the game.                       David’s father, Ken Morley, once described his first impressions                 of Jack as a “barrow boy,” or a street hawker. “He really wanted to                 practice  his  English,  and  he  was  very  friendly.  Our  kids  were  very                 impressed.”                       David described how the family stayed in touch: “What followed                 that meeting was a pen pal relationship that I kept up for a few years                  until my father started to take an interest in helping this young man.”                 Jack would correspond regularly with Ken, referring to him as “Dad,”                 who asked him to “double space his letters so that any corrections                 could be sent back in the spaces.” David explained, “The original with                 corrections was returned for learning purposes with the reply letter. I                 believe this greatly helped and encouraged Jack to continue with his                 English studies.”","Jack Ma, age fifteen, with his new Australian friend David Morley by West Lake.

The Morley Family                        Armed with his improving English, rich knowledge of the history                 of  the  area,  and  a  knack  for  storytelling,  Jack  embraced  the                  opportunity to show more foreign tourists around the sights of West                 Lake. He relished visiting Hangzhou’s teahouses, where locals would                 play Chinese chess and cards and recount “tall tales.”                       Jack  would  often  accompany  his  grandmother  to  Buddhist                 temples  to  burn  incense  and  worship  the  gods.  He  developed  a                 passion for tai chi and reading The Water Margin, a classic Chinese                 tale  that  features  108  heroes—the  number  of  employees  he  later                 would set as an early head count target for Alibaba.                       But  by  far  his  favorite  works  are  those  of  Hong  Kong  author                  Louis  Cha,  who  writes  under  the  pen  name  Jin  Yong.  Born  in                 Zhejiang  Province  in  1924,  Jin  Yong  cofounded  in  1959  the  Hong                 Kong newspaper Ming Pao, which published many of his early works.                 In  total,  he  authored  fifteen  novels,  all  in  the  wuxia  genre,  which                 blends  historical  and  fictional  tales  of  martial  arts  and  chivalry.  Jin                 Yong  is  highly  popular  in  the  Chinese-speaking  world.  Worldwide                  sales of his books have topped 100 million copies. There have been                 more than ninety television series and film adaptations of his work.","One of Jack’s childhood pen pal letters to David Morley. The Morley family                        Set between the sixth century BC and the eighteenth century, Jin                 Yong’s  works  contain  strong  elements  of  Chinese  patriotism,  pitting                 heroic  peoples  against  northern  invaders  such  as  the  Mongols  and                 Manchus.                       Yi  Zhongtian,  a  well-known  writer  and  a  professor  at  Xiamen                 University, summarized the popular appeal of traditional stories and                  martial  arts  as  follows:  “In  traditional  Chinese  society,  people  have                 three  dreams.  The  first  is  a  wise  emperor.  People  hope  to  have  a                 good leader so that they can have peace in the country. The second                 dream is clean officials. If there are no clean officials, then comes the                 third  dream,  chivalrous  heroes.  People  hope  that  the  heroes  could                 stand for them, kill the greedy officials, and bring justice back to the                 society.  However,  if  there  are  no  heroes,  people  can  only  seek                 comfort from martial arts fiction. That’s why many Chinese people like                 kung fu novels.”","Jin Yong’s writing is suffused with traditional elements of Chinese                 culture  and  arts,  as  well  as  Buddhism,  Taoism,  and  Confucianism.                 Jack  found  inspiration  in  Jin  Yong’s  legendary  warrior  Feng                 Qingyang.  Feng  was  a  teacher.  His  martial  arts  moves  were  never                  performed to any set plan.                                                                                                        2                       In his own practice of martial arts, Jack was trained in tai chi  by                 a  woman  in  her  seventies  who,  according  to  Chen  Wei—a  former                 student of Jack’s who is now his personal assistant—was so skilled                 that  she  could  defend  herself  against  two  or  three  younger  men.                 Every morning she would close her eyes to meditate before practicing                  tai chi, “listening to the sound of flowers blooming.” Today Jack often                 travels with a personal tai chi coach.                       But these skills were of little use against one of Jack’s earliest                 foes:  math.  In  China,  all  high  school  students  hoping  to  go  on  to                 higher  education  have  to  pass  a  merit-based  national  higher                 education entrance exam, commonly known as the gaokao, literally                 the “high test.” The gaokao takes place over two or three days. Math,                  along with Chinese and a foreign language, is mandatory.                       The gaokao is widely seen as one of the most challenging in the                 world,  requiring  a  huge  amount  of  preparation  and  memorization.                 Today  there  is  growing  criticism  of  the  exam’s  negative  social                 consequences, including depression and suicide.                       Jack took the gaokao but failed badly, scoring 1/120 in math. His                 hopes crushed, he took to menial labor delivering heavy bundles of                 magazines from printers to the Hangzhou train station on a pedicab,                  a job Jack managed to land thanks only to his father’s connections.                 Jack was rejected from numerous other jobs, including as a waiter in                 a hotel. He was told he was not tall enough.                       Chen Wei relates in his biography of Jack, This Is Still Ma Yun,                 how  his  boss  found  inspiration  in  the  book  Life,  written  by  the                 Chinese author Lu Yao. Published in 1982, and made into a film in                 1984, the book relates the story of Gao Jialin. A talented man living in                  a village, Gao struggles but ultimately fails to escape the clutches of                 poverty. Jack resolved to have a different fate, and took the gaokao                 again. This time his math score improved slightly, to 19/120, but his                 overall score dropped considerably.","Jack once again set about applying for jobs to make ends meet.                 He  sent  out  eleven  job  applications  but  all  met  with  rejection.  Jack                 likes to tell the story of how even KFC turned him away, the only one                 of twenty-four candidates they didn’t like.                        Undeterred, Jack became a regular every Sunday at the library                 of Zhejiang University, where he committed to memory the formulas                 and equations he would have to master to pass the test.                       Jack never gained admission to a prestigious university in Beijing                 or Shanghai. But in 1984, when he was nineteen, he raised his math                 score  sufficiently  to  win  acceptance  to  a  local  university,  the                 Hangzhou Teachers College. On his third attempt at the gaokao he                 scored  89  in  math.  His  score  was  several  points  below  the  normal                  acceptance  rate  at  other  universities  for  a  full  four-year                                                3                 undergraduate degree.  Normally he would have been relegated to a                                                                                     4                 two-  to  three-year  associate’s  degree  course,   but  Hangzhou                 Teachers College had a few spaces left for male students, and Jack                 squeaked  in.  The  college  was  not  a  prestigious  one.  Jack  recalled                 that  “it  was  considered  the  third  or  fourth  class  of  my  city.”  In  his                 public appearances, Jack often speaks of his twice failing the gaokao                 as a badge of honor.                     Teacher                  In  his  sophomore  year,  Jack  was  elected  president  of  the  school’s                 student  union,  where  he  launched  a  Top  Ten  Campus  Singers                 Competition,  and  was  later  president  of  the  Hangzhou  Students                  Federation.                       In 1985, Jack also received an invitation from Ken Morley to stay                 with his family at their home in New Lambton, Australia, a suburb of                 Newcastle  in  New  South  Wales.  It  was  the  first  time  Jack  had  left                 China. He stayed for a month and returned a changed man.                       “Everything I’d learned in China was that China was the richest                 country in the world,” Jack later said. “When I arrived in Australia, I                 realized it was totally different. I started to think you have to use your                 own mind to judge, to think.”                        Jack  has  never  shown  any  hint  of  shyness  toward  foreigners.                 During his trip to Australia, Jack gave a demonstration to a local tai","chi  group  gathered  in  a  suburban  hall,  showing  off  his  skills  at                 monkey-  and  drunken-style  kung  fu.  “I’d  often  request  he  do  his                 drunken  boxing  routine,  it  was  great  to  watch,”  Stephen  Morley                 recalls.                                                 Stephen Morley, Jack, and Anne Lee, a cousin of the Morleys. Louis and Anne Lee                        Jack’s friendship with the Morleys blossomed. After Jack’s trip to                  Australia, Ken Morley made a return visit to Hangzhou with Stephen.                 As the Ma family home was too small to host guests, Jack arranged                 accommodation at a student college for the Morleys. “We would have                 dinner  at  the  Ma  household  and  cycle  to  the  college  after  dinner,”                 Stephen recalls. “Jack would always help prepare and cook dinner,                 always making us feel special.”                                                                          Louis and Anne Lee","During their holiday, Jack planned a trip out to the countryside for                 his  two  Australian  friends,  and  they  got  their  fair  share  of Chinese                 adventures.  For  transportation,  Jack  secured  the  use  of  a  pickup                 truck. He and the driver sat up front in the cab while Ken and Stephen                  sat on two loose chairs that Jack had placed on the open-top cargo                 bed. On their way out of Hangzhou one day, the driver had to break                 suddenly to avoid a cyclist who had fallen off his bike, sending Ken                 and Stephen hurtling forward into the rear of the cab. Fortunately they                 escaped  injury.  Back  in  town  later  that  evening,  Jack  arranged  a                 banquet for his Australian friends with some local officials and VIPs,                 looking  out  over  a  street  below  where  a  festival  was  taking  place.                 Stephen  recalls,  “I’d  never  seen  so  many  people  congested  in  one                  place.  It  became  clear  then  that  Jack  was  a  bit  of  a  networker,                 organizing  a  vehicle  and  a  dinner  with  the  mayor  required                 connections.”                       Back in Hangzhou, Jack’s university life was not carefree. Money                 concerns were pressing. Once again Ken Morley stepped in to help.                 While the tuition at the college was free, the compulsory live-in fees                 were  beyond  the  means  of  Jack’s  family.  “When  we  came  back  to                  Australia we thought about it,” Morley recalled, “and decided we could                 help. It was not much—five to ten dollars a week, I think—so I would                 send him a check every six months.”                       At  Hangzhou  Teachers  College,  Jack  met  and  fell  in  love  with                 Zhang  Ying,  a  fellow  student  and  Zhejiang-native  who  had  taken                 Cathy as her first name. The relationship was kept secret from Jack’s                 family. During a dinner one evening in Hangzhou with his father, Jack,                 and his parents, Stephen Morley recalled, “I blurted out ‘nü peng you’                  [girlfriend]  and  gestured  towards  Jack.  Jack  looked  mortified  and                 probably wanted to kill me at this point. This led to a discussion in                 Mandarin between Jack and his parents. Jack still reminds me of the                 time I blabbed on him as a kid.”","Ma Yin (Jack’s sister), Stephen Morley, Ken Morley, and Jack in Hangzhou. The Morley                                                            family                                                     Jack inside the kitchen of the new apartment that Ken Morley helped him purchase in                                                Hangzhou. The Morley Family                        Despite  being  outed  by  their  young  Australian  friend,  the                 relationship between Jack and Cathy endured and they were married                 soon after. The Morleys once again showed their generosity and gave","the couple 22,000 Australian dollars (about $18,000) to help finance                 the  purchase  of  their  first  home,  two  apartments  on  top  of  a  tower                 block that they combined together to make a penthouse.                       Jack later said that words could not express what Ken and Judy                  Morley had done for him.                       Ken Morley died in September 2004 at the age of seventy-eight.                 His  obituary  in  a  local  newspaper  records  that  he  had  taken  “his                 children  to  China  and  Cuba  and  encouraged  them  to  get  an                 education,  travel  and  have  a  political  point  of  view.  This  broad-                 minded, generous approach extended outside the family and Ken is                 well-known  for  befriending  a  poor  young  Chinese  boy.  This  boy  is                 now  a  man  who  heads  a  successful  company  in  China.”  At  the                  funeral,  a  clergyman  read  out  a  message  from  Jack  to  the  Morley                 family  in  which  he  disclosed  a  plan  he  had  to  one  day  travel  the                 Trans-Siberian  Railway  with  Ken,  whom  he  described  as  his                 “Australian ‘Dad’ and mentor.” His son David wrote to me, “It may be                 a  fantasy  now,  and  with  his  celebrity  status  something  difficult  to                 achieve for Jack incognito, but I would like one day to fulfill the idea of                 that trip on behalf of my father.”                                                  Jack and a fellow lecturer prepare to host a talk by Jack’s mentor, Ken Morley, in April 1991                                          at the Hangzhou YMCA. The Morley Family                        The irony is that Ken Morley, who was instrumental in unlocking                  opportunities  for  a  man  who  would  become  one  of  China’s  richest","capitalists, was himself a committed socialist. Born the son of a miner                 and a seamstress, he was a longtime political activist and member of                 the Communist Party of Australia, presenting himself as a candidate                 in  local  elections  for  the  Socialist  Alliance.  In  the  years  before  he                  died, he would witness some of Jack’s early success, expressing his                 embarrassment  at  the  money  and  gifts  Jack  and  Cathy  liked  to                 shower  on  him.  Instead  he  treasured  most,  he  said,  the  honor  that                 Jack and Cathy bestowed on him by naming their eldest child after                 him (calling him “Kun,” an approximation of Ken). China impacted the                 Morleys, too: Susan Morley went on to study Chinese in Sydney for                 several  years.  The  Ma  and  Morley  families  remain  close  friends  to                 this day and continue to vacation together.                                                            Jack and Ken Morley sharing some beer. The Morley Family                     To Get Rich Is Glorious                  In  1992,  Deng  Xiaoping  undertook  his  famous  “southern  tour,”                                  5                 immortalized  in his pronouncement that “to get rich is glorious.” For                 the  country’s  entrepreneurs,  relegated  to  the  margins  of  society,                  Deng’s endorsement was an unambiguous invitation to return to the                 fold.                       But Jack was not yet an entrepreneur. Upon graduating in 1988,                 with  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  English,  he  had  become  a  lecturer  in                 English and international trade at the Hangzhou Institute of Electronic                 Engineering.  While  his  fellow  students  were  all  assigned  to  teach","English in middle schools, Jack was the only one among five hundred                 graduates to be assigned to teach in an institution of higher learning.                 But he had started to think of a future beyond teaching. Jack recalled                 the lesson he drew from Deng’s southern tour: “You can be rich; you                  can help other people be rich.” Although he was keen to serve out the                 remaining  two  years  of  his  contract,  Jack  began  to  pursue                 opportunities outside his school.                       After  his  day  job  at  the  institute,  he  started  teaching  English                 classes  at  the  Hangzhou  YMCA.  According  to  Chen  Wei,  who  first                 attended  a  class  in  1992,  Jack’s  English  classes  were  popular                 because he spent little time teaching grammar, vocabulary, or reading                 out  texts.  Instead  Jack  preferred  to  pick  a  topic  and  engage  in                  conversation. His students came from a wide variety of backgrounds,                 from high schoolers striving to study overseas, to college students, to                 factory  workers  and  young  professionals.  Jack  would  often  spend                 time with them after class, “drinking tea, playing cards, and chatting.”                       Hangzhou  had  a  regular  “English  corner,”  a  gathering  of  local                 residents keen to practice their language skills on one another, which                 met every Sunday morning in the Six Park beside West Lake. Jack                  would  take  along  his  students  from  night  school,  but  as  they  were                 eager to go more often, he decided to launch his own English corner.                 His sessions were held every Wednesday night, with Jack finding that                 the anonymity that darkness conferred made his students less self-                 conscious in practicing their imperfect English.                       But Jack’s teaching days were coming to an end. Swept up in the                 enthusiasm  that  Deng  Xiaoping’s  southern  tour  had  fanned,  he                 resolved to launch his own business before he turned thirty. Working                  part-time  on  his  new  business,  after  class,  he  named  his  first                 company “Hope.”","Chapter Four                               Hope and Coming to America                           China has a million companies that want to sell abroad, but they don’t                                                        know how.                                                        —Jack Ma                     In  January  1994,  at  the  age  of  twenty-nine,  Jack  founded  the                 Hangzhou Haibo Translation Agency. When the company first started                  there were only five staff members, mostly retired teachers from the                 institute.  He  rented  two  rooms  at  27  Qingnian  Road,  not  far  from                 West Lake in a converted church that once housed the YMCA. Today                 the sign for Hope Translation still hangs outside, where the translation                 agency maintains a meeting room, adjacent to what has become the                 YMCA International Youth Hostel.                       Jack convinced some students from his English night school to                  lend a hand with the business, largely to help find his first clients. On                 opening day, his students went to Wulin Square with banners to help                 publicize the company.                       A few of these students ended up joining the company full-time.                 One of the early employees was Zhang Hong. She met Jack in 1993,                 when  he  was  teaching  advanced  oral  English  at  the  YMCA.  She                 recalled, “Nobody else saw the opportunity in this business. . . . We                 didn’t make much money at first, but [Jack] persevered. . . . I respect                  him tremendously for he has a great ability to motivate people and he                 can invest things that seem hopeless with exciting possibility. He can                 make those around him get excited about life.”                       Jack’s  first  business  was  focused  on  helping  local  companies                 find customers overseas. Jack later recalled, “I had to teach during                 the day, and had no time to help others do translation work. But lots","of retired teachers had nothing to do at home, and their pension was                 low,  so  I  wanted  to  found  a  translation  company,  to  be  an                 intermediary.”  With  its  narrow  focus  on  translation,  Jack  would  not                 find  commercial  success  with  Hope.  But  his  first  venture  gave  him                  direct  exposure  to  the  entrepreneurial  revolution  that  was                 transforming Zhejiang and his first tentative steps as an entrepreneur                 himself.                       The Chinese word for Hope was Haibo, which literally translates                 as “vast like the sea.” Popular slang for leaving a government job and                 entering the private sector at the time was to xia hai, or to “jump into                 the sea.”                       Jack wanted to get his feet wet as an entrepreneur, but he wasn’t                  quite ready to take the plunge and abandon his public sector job as a                 teacher. Entrepreneurship is such a well-established part of modern                 Chinese business and culture today that it is easy to forget how much                 things have changed in the last few decades.                       In     the     earliest     days      of     China’s      economic         reforms,                 entrepreneurship  was  viewed  as  a  highly  risky,  even  illegal                 undertaking. Memories then were fresh of those imprisoned or even                  executed during the Cultural Revolution for carrying out commercial                 activities.                       From  1978,  the  establishment  of  a  “household  contract                 responsibility  system”  allowed  farmers  to  sell  surplus  crops  on  the                 open  market.  The  first  embers  of  private  business  started  to  grow                 with  the  township  and  village  enterprises  (TVEs).  The  TVEs  were                 nominally state-controlled but in effect privately run rural enterprises.                 The spark was lit for a rapid expansion of private sector employment                  in China.                       From  the  early  1980s,  the  Chinese  government  began  to                                                     1                 recognize  entrepreneurs,   first  individual  entrepreneurs  then                 businesses run by entrepreneurs.                       The  first  entrepreneurs,  the  getihu,  were  not  leaving  behind  a                  stable  government  job,  but  rather  were  those  with  nothing  to  lose.                 They  were  mostly  agricultural  laborers,  their  low  status  inviting  the                 pejorative  association  of  “peddlers.”  As  they  grew  richer  they  were                 resented and mocked for their success and lack of class. One early                 getihu even papered the walls of his home with banknotes.","Some of the richest businesspeople in China today started out as                 lowly  getihu,  many  in  Zhejiang  Province.  To  understand  Alibaba’s                 rise, it is helpful to understand how Jack’s home province became the                 source of so much wealth.                     Zhejiang: China’s Crucible of Entrepreneurship                  Hangzhou,  the  nearby  port  of  Ningbo,  and  other  industrial  clusters                 dotting  northern  Zhejiang  and  southern  Jiangsu  Provinces  form  the                  economic powerhouse of the Yangtze River delta, with Shanghai as                 its center.                       Home  to  Alibaba’s  e-commerce  empire,  Hangzhou  has  a  long                 tradition  as  a  trading  center.  The  city  once  served  as  the                 southernmost  point  of  the  1,100-mile-long  Grand  Canal,  whose  full                 name in Chinese is Jing Hang Da Yun He, or the Beijing-Hangzhou                  Grand Canal. For more than a thousand years, the Grand Canal was                 the  main  trading  artery  between  south  and  north  China,  making                 Hangzhou one of the most prosperous cities in China.                   2                       Hangzhou  and  the  nearby  port  of  Ningbo  lie  on  relatively  flat                 land.  But  much  of  Zhejiang  Province  is  mountainous,  its  elevations                 and rivers creating a patchwork of isolated communities and dialects.                 The need to trade and the distance from the country’s political rulers                  have helped make Zhejiang the cradle of private enterprise in China.                 Today many of the province’s entrepreneurs sit atop China’s rich list.                 Most, like Jack, started out living hardscrabble lives.                       Zong  Qinghou,  worth  more  than  $11  billion,  is  the  founder  of                 Wahaha,  China’s  largest  beverage  manufacturer.  From  the  age  of                 four, Zong grew up in Hangzhou, later working on a salt farm on an                  island  off  the  coast  of  Ningbo  before  graduating  from  secondary                 school. In the 1980s he sold ice pops on the street for less than a                 penny. Li Shufu, worth more than $2 billion, founded Geely, China’s                 first  non-state-owned  car  manufacturer.  He  started  out  assembling                 refrigerators using spare parts, then in 1988 founded Geely. In 2010                 Geely purchased Sweden’s Volvo Cars. Lu Guanqiu, worth more than                 $7  billion,  is  the  founder  of  Wanxiang  Group,  the  Hangzhou-based                 auto  parts  manufacturer.  He  started  out  as  a  farmer,  then  started                 buying scrap metal from villagers.","Jack’s  friend  Guo  Guangchang,  a  man  worth  an  estimated  $7                 billion  before  his  unexplained  disappearance  for  several  days  in                 December  2015,  is  the  founder  of  investment  firm  Fosun.  Guo                 survived  the  Cultural  Revolution  only  by  eating  moldy,  dried                  vegetables,  later  winning  entry  to  Shanghai’s  prestigious  Fudan                 University,  where  he  sold  bread  door-to-door  in  the  dorms  to  make                 ends meet. Prior to his surprise absence in 2015, Fosun had been                 described  by  the  Financial  Times  as  the  “Berkshire  Hathaway  of                 China.”  Guo  is  an  active  supporter  of  Alibaba’s  forays  into  logistics                 and finance.                       As we saw in the logistics edge of the iron triangle, one cluster of                 Zhejiang  entrepreneurs  has  played  an  important  role  in  Alibaba’s                  success. The Tonglu Gang of logistics companies, located in the town                 of Tonglu to the southwest of Hangzhou, account for more than half of                 all package deliveries in China. Tonglu was the birthplace of the late                 Nie Tengfei, founder of courier giant Shentong (STO Express). Born                 into poverty, Nie raised pigs, planted grain, and sold firewood before                 moving to Hangzhou to work in a printing factory. He moonlighted as                 a  courier  delivering  bread  on  his  tricycle  before  spotting  an                                                                                              3                 opportunity  at  the  age  of  twenty  to  beat  China  Post,   delivering                 customs  forms  for  trading  companies  in  Hangzhou  to  the  port  in                 Shanghai. Nie died in a car crash in 1998, but Shentong continued to                 thrive. Two of Nie’s relatives and one of his classmates each founded                  three other large courier companies in the Tonglu Gang.                   4                       Hangzhou,  the  provincial  capital,  and  Ningbo,  its  largest  port,                 have  long  been  prosperous  trading  centers.  But  two  other  cities  in                 Zhejiang, Wenzhou and Yiwu, though less well known overseas are                 renowned  in  China  for  their  newfound  wealth.  Wenzhou  helped                 legitimize the role of entrepreneurs in society, and Yiwu established                 the  wholesale  markets  that  extended  their  reach  to  all  parts  of  the                  country  and  indeed  the  world.  Wenzhou  and  Yiwu  have  played  as                 important  a  part  in  China’s  entrepreneurial  revolution  as  the  cotton                 mills of Lancashire did in Britain’s industrial revolution.                       Wenzhou and Yiwu provided the dynamism that inspired Jack to                 launch  his  own  entrepreneurial  career.  Innovations  in  Wenzhou                 opened  the  door  for  Alibaba’s  future  forays  into  financial  services,                 and  the  massive  wholesale  market  in  Yiwu  was  a  template  for","Alibaba’s  first  business  model,  connecting  merchants  in  China  with                 global buyers. Let us take a brief tour.                     Wenzhou                  Wenzhou lies two hundred miles southeast of Hangzhou. Hemmed in                 by  mountains  on  one  side  and  the  East  China  Sea  on  the  other,                 Wenzhou  had  always  looked  to  trade,  including  tea  exports,  for  its                 livelihood. But after 1949, its proximity to nationalist Taiwan became a                  liability. With Shanghai a three-hundred-mile ferry ride away, the city                 suffered from its isolation.                       Wenzhou  had  little  arable  land  and  many  unemployed  or                 underemployed  agricultural  workers.  But  once  Deng  Xiaoping                 launched his economic reforms in 1978, the private sector started to                 boom. Wenzhou’s entrepreneurs, often working with family members,                  started out in light manufacturing. In the 1980s they were some of the                 first merchants to fan out across China to sell their wares, including                 knockoffs  of  Western  brands.  For  many,  Chinese  goods  from                 Wenzhou  were  the  first  items  they  ever  purchased  that  were  not                 made by the state.                       Wenzhou          has     played       a     pivotal     role     in    legitimizing                 entrepreneurship  in  China.  In  1984  the  Wenzhou  municipal                 government invited the city’s most successful private entrepreneurs to                 a  conference.  Although  the  government  wanted  to  help  them                  showcase  their  success,  many  entrepreneurs  refused  to  attend,                 fearing  arrest.  Only  two  years  earlier  a  number  of  entrepreneurs  in                 the  city  had  been  arrested  for  speculation.  They  still  languished  in                 prison. Of the entrepreneurs who showed up for the meeting with the                 government a number brought along their toothbrushes, in case they                 too  were  detained.  But  the  entrepreneurs  were  not  jailed.  After                 releasing those arrested two years earlier, the Wenzhou government                  published  an  unprecedented  admission  in  local  newspapers  that  it                 had erred. Professor Yasheng Huang at the Massachusetts Institute                 of  Technology  writes  that  “many  entrepreneurs  cited  these  two                 episodes as having convinced them of their personal security.”                       For decades in China, the country’s state-owned banks ignored                 private enterprises and individuals, making politically directed loans                     5","to the state-owned enterprises (SOEs).                       Starved  for  lending,  the  private  sector  in  Wenzhou  began  to                 devise its own private credit market, often adopting illegal structures.                 The local government actively supported the establishment of private                  credit associations, cooperatives, and money houses—a form of local                 financial broker that derives profits from the spread between rates of                 interest  on  deposits  and  loans—forming  a  system  that  came  to  be                 known  as  the  “Wenzhou  model.”  Wenzhou  paved  the  way  for                 Alibaba’s own foray into banking. When Alibaba received its banking                 license in 2014, two of the other five recipients were from Wenzhou.                       Raw  entrepreneurial  spirit,  plus  access  to  capital,  fueled  an                 explosion in the city’s private sector, which so dominated Wenzhou’s                  economy  that  the  state  became  completely  marginalized.  Facing  a                 huge  demand  for  new  roads  and  bridges,  the  entrepreneurs  of                 Wenzhou  didn’t  wait  for  funds  or  instructions  from  Beijing.  They                 simply  built  their  own,  in  a  surge  of  construction  that  bordered  on                 anarchy, lacking any coordinated plan.                       In  1990,  acting  on  their  own,  entrepreneurs  even  funded  the                 construction  of  the  city’s  airport.  One  year  later  the  country’s  first                  private  carrier,  Juneyao  Airlines,  was  launched  in  the  city.  In  1998,                 Wenzhou created China’s first privately funded railroad.                       Today in China, Wenzhou is synonymous with wealth. The city’s                 residents  are  resented  by  some  for  their  mass  shopping  sprees,                 always paying cash, which have driven up the prices of apartments in                 Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, New York City, and beyond.                     Yiwu                  Yiwu is an unlikely location for one of the world’s key trading nodes. It                 is located inland, far from Hangzhou, Ningbo, or the East China Sea.                 Like Wenzhou, it was dirt poor, with little cultivable land. Lacking any                  alternative, local farmers since the sixteenth century turned to trade.                 Their main product was brown sugar, which they cooked with ginger                 and  cut into  chunks.  This they bartered  for chicken  feathers, which                 they used to make feather dusters or mulched to make fertilizer.                       In  the  winters,  when  the  farmers  had  little  to  do  and  food  was                 scarce, local men would hoist a pole with bamboo baskets on their","shoulders and travel the country as peddlers. They carried out sugar                 chunks,  sewing  needles,  and  thread,  and  brought  chicken  feathers                 back to Yiwu. As they walked they would use a rattle drum to attract                 customers.  They  became  known  as  “Sugar  Shoulder-Pole  Men”—a                  precursor to today’s million-strong courier workforce.                       Soon there were so many itinerant merchants in Yiwu that they                 formed  a  veritable  mobile  army.  To  supply  them  with  wares  in  the                 1700s, the first wholesale markets started to appear in the city. Trade                 flourished for centuries until the dislocation of the Japanese invasion                 and the communist revolution.                       When  Deng  Xiaoping’s  reforms  started  to  take  effect,  the                 wholesale  trade  came  out  of  the  shadows.  In  September  1982,                  traders in Yiwu were allowed access to a patch of land—a ditch that                 they had first cemented over—to set up their stalls. Seven hundred                 stalls  popped  up  almost  immediately  and  Yiwu  became  one  of  the                 first wholesale markets of its kind in postrevolutionary China.                       Today  the  city  is  home  to  the  largest  wholesale  market  in  the                 world and its population has shot up to over two million people. An                 estimated  40,000  people  visit the wholesale  market every  day. The                  700 stalls have become 70,000 outlets, housed today inside the Yiwu                 International Trade Center. This colossal building spans more than 40                 million square feet, generating a turnover of more than $6 billion per                 year.                       On sale inside are an estimated 1.7 million products, from toys to                 plastic  flowers,  jewelry  to  suitcases,  clothing  to  home  appliances,                 anything and everything that is Made in China. Without knowing it, a                 huge amount of what we consume in the West has passed through                  Yiwu. Even Christmas is “Made in Yiwu”: More than 60 percent of the                 world’s Christmas decorations are manufactured in the city. Although                 traders travel there overwhelmingly for its cheap prices, part of Yiwu’s                 attraction  has  been  its  supply  of  counterfeit  products,  for  example                 handbags  sold  under  almost-familiar-sounding  names  such  as                 “Gussi.” The Financial Times journalist James Kynge traveled to the                 city in 2005 to research the problem of fake goods, only to find out                  that even hotels there were fake: He passed by not the Hyatt but the                 “Hiyat.”","Yiwu attracts traders from all four corners of the world. The town                 is a favorite of traders from the Middle East, making Yiwu home to the                 fastest-growing  Muslim  community  in  China.  With  an  estimated                 35,000 Muslims in the city at any time—Chinese, South Asian, and                  Arab—Yiwu features dozens of Muslim restaurants and an ornate $4                 million mosque featuring marble imported from Iran.                       Since 2014, Yiwu is the start of the longest freight railroad line in                 the world. Taking twenty-one days to traverse end to end, the 8,111-                 mile line links Yiwu with Madrid.                       What makes  Yiwu  such  an  essential  node  is  its role  marketing                 the goods of the countless industrial clusters of Zhejiang and other                 parts  of  the  Yangtze  River  delta.  These  single-product  towns  can                  represent  80  percent  or  more  of  the  production  of  individual                 commodities—not  just  in  China  but  worldwide.  Shaoxing  is  “textile                 city” and Yongkang is “hardware city,” churning out 30,000 steel doors                 and 150,000 motor scooters every day. Taizhou is known as “sewing                 machine  city”  and  Shenzhou  as  “necktie  city.”  Haining  calls  itself                 “leather  city.”  There  is  even  a  “toothbrush  city”—in  case  nervous                 entrepreneurs get a summons from their local government official—in                  Hangji.                       Yiwu  itself  claims  to  be  China’s  “sock  city,”  producing  annually                 more than three billion pairs of socks for companies like Walmart and                 Disney,  although  Datang,  near  Hangzhou,  also  claims  to  be  “sock                 city,” producing more than eight billion pairs each year.                       By  the  mid-1990s,  when  Jack  was  starting  his  own  business                 career, Zhejiang was already an entrepreneurial powerhouse. But the                 province’s  companies  were  highly  labor-intensive  and  their  average                  size  small.  From  hardly  any  entrepreneurs  at  the  beginning  of  the                 1980s, by 1994 Zhejiang arguably had too many. In a population of                 44 million people, the province was home to an estimated 10 million                 economic entities.                       Many manufacturers struggled to find enough customers to make                 a  profit.  Unlike  the  factories  in  southern  China  set  up  by  wealthy                 overseas  Chinese  in  Hong  Kong  and  Taiwan,  the small  factories  in                                                                                         6                 Zhejiang had to hustle to find customers and finance.  China’s state-                 owned  banks  denied  them  any  credit.  This  chronic  lack  of  funding                 created innovations in private finance, such as the Wenzhou model,","and led to the rise of industrial clusters that bound together debtors                 and  creditors,  who  could  dole  out  capital  based  on  the  profit  they                 believed would be generated by a specific contract. By 2004, of the                 top hundred largest domestic private firms in China, half came from                  Zhejiang Province.                       Jack  recognized  early  on  both  the  region’s  strengths  and  its                 shortcomings,  and  is  a  proud  advocate  for  the  province.  Since                 October 2015,  he  serves  as the inaugural  chairman  of the General                 Association of Zhejiang Entrepreneurs. In his inaugural speech, Jack                 talked about the six million Zhejiang entrepreneurs in China and the                 two  million  Zhejiang  entrepreneurs  around  the  world:  “The  total                 number  of  over  eight  million  Zhejiang  entrepreneurs  might  be  the                  largest business association in the world. They have created another                 economic entity in addition to the local economy in Zhejiang.” Their                 successes  weren’t  won  easily  though.  In  an  earlier  speech  to  the                 Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce, Jack summed up the dynamism of                 his  home  province:  “As  entrepreneurs  from  Zhejiang,  our  greatest                 advantages  are  that  we  are  hardworking,  courageous,  and  good  at                 seizing opportunities. We have these excellent qualities because we                  were  given  nothing.  We  are  not  like  other  provinces  which  have                 resources of coal and ore. We Zhejiang entrepreneurs have markets.                 .  .  .  As  long  as  we  are  in  places  where  there  are  people,  we  are                 always able to find opportunities. It will be the same in the future.”                       Yet  Jack’s  first  effort  to  tap  into  Zhejiang’s  entrepreneurial  fizz                 was not a success. In 1994, his Hope Translation venture had gotten                 off to a troubled start. While his monthly office rent was almost $300,                 his first month’s income was just over $20. Hope may spring eternal,                  but cash is king. Jack was facing a crunch. To support his venture,                 Jack  started  peddling  goods  on  the  streets  of  Hangzhou,  including                 some he sourced from Yiwu. His translation company also became a                 trading  company.  Hope  Translation  Agency  started  to  sell  gifts,                 flowers,  books,  and  even  plastic  carpet,  a  range  of  items  that                 foreshadows Taobao. Jack recalled, “We did everything. This income                 supported  the translation  agency  for three  years  until  we  started to                  make ends meet. We believed that as long as we kept doing it, we                 would definitely have a future.”","But it was becoming clear to Jack that translation services alone                 were  not  going  to  sate  his  entrepreneurial  ambitions.  Soon  an                 unexpected journey, which looked at first like a disaster, was about to                 give Jack a lucky break.                        With his  reputation  as an  expert  English  speaker  growing  from                 his popular evening classes and his Hope Translation venture, Jack                 was asked by the government of Tonglu County—some fifty miles to                 the  southwest  of  Hangzhou  and  later  home  to  the  Tonglu  Gang  of                 logistic  companies—to  assist  as  an  interpreter  in  helping  resolve  a                 dispute  with  an  American  company  over  the  construction  of  a  new                 highway.                       In 1994, the company had proposed to invest in a new highway                  to be built from Hangzhou to Tonglu. After a year of negotiations, no                 agreement had been reached, and the initial funding promised by the                 partner in the United States had not materialized. Jack was tapped to                 find out what was going on, and hopefully end the deadlock.                       First  Jack  traveled  to  Hong  Kong,  where  he  was  told  that  the                 company’s funds were held in the United States, so Jack embarked                 on his first trip there. He would stay for a month. His mission for the                  Tonglu government was a failure. But the trip would give him his first                 exposure  to  the  Internet,  and  he  would  return  to  China  a  changed                 man.                     Going to America                  His  first  trip  to  America  sounds  more  like  a  plot  for  an  Ocean’s                 Eleven–style crime caper than an interpreter’s business trip, at least                 according to the version put out five years later during the dot-com                 boom when media started to take an interest in Jack’s background.                 Upon  arriving  in  Los  Angeles,  the  story  goes,  Jack  met  with  the                 unnamed boss of Tonglu’s erstwhile U.S. partner. Jack quickly figured                  out,  as  The  Economist  related,  that  the  “company  he  was                 investigating  did  not  exist,  that  his  host  was  a  crook,  and  that  he                 himself was in serious danger.” Jack has never named the boss, later                 described  in  local  media  only  as  a  “bulky  Californian.”  But  after                 refusing  to  take  a  bribe,  Jack  recalled  he  was  locked  in  a  beach                 house in Malibu, where his captor flashed a gun. He was then taken","to Las Vegas, where he was kept in a form of house arrest in a hotel                 room on the top floor of a casino. Jack hasn’t repeated the details of                 any  of  this  in  recent  years.  His  personal  assistant,  Chen  Wei,  has                 written that it is an episode that Jack prefers to forget. A few years                  after the incident, when Alibaba was beginning to gain international                 prominence,  Jack  told  a  similar  story  to  Melinda  Liu,  the  Beijing                 bureau  chief  for  Newsweek:  “I  flew  to  Hangzhou  for  an  exclusive                 interview with Jack, and he spent a generous amount of time showing                 me around the Alibaba headquarters and talking at length about his                 life. He said that, on his very first trip to the USA, a former business                 contact (an American) had ‘virtually kidnapped’ him in a failed attempt                 to get Jack to work for him. At the time, Jack was pretty matter-of-                  fact, and  the  anecdote  was  just  one  of  many  he  recounted.  I  later                 contacted  him  requesting  more  information;  he  indicated  he  didn’t                 want  to  make  too  much  of  it  and  declined  to  provide  additional                 details.”  The  bizarre  story  ends  with  Jack  escaping  his  hotel  room                 and  winning  $600  on  slot  machines  in  the  casino.  Abandoning  his                 belongings upstairs, he escapes the casino and buys an airline ticket                 for  Seattle.  A  less  colorful  version  of  the  story  was  detailed  in  an                                                                                                    7                 article  published  in  September  1995  in  the  Hangzhou  Daily,  which                 says Jack had taken along $4,000 in savings and money borrowed                 from his wife Cathy’s mother and his brother-in-law.                       In  any  event,  it  was  in  Seattle  that  Jack  first  logged  on  to  the                 Internet.  He  had  heard  about  the  Internet  the  previous  year  from  a                 fellow English teacher in Hangzhou, called Bill Aho. Bill’s son-in-law                  was  working  on  an  Internet-related  business,  which  Bill  described.                 Jack recalled that it was Bill who first told him about the Internet, but                 that he “couldn’t explain it clearly either, it sounded very strange. . . . I                 couldn’t really understand it either.”                       In Seattle, Jack stayed at the house of Bill Aho’s relatives, Dave                 and Dolores Selig.                       Jack  was  shown  around  the  wealthier  districts  of  the  city,                  including  the  Queen  Anne  neighborhood.  Dolores  Selig  recalled  to                 the BBC that Jack was impressed by some of the larger houses on                 the hill: “Jack would point at various houses and say ‘I’m going to buy                 that one, and that one and that one’ and we’d just laugh because they","were  very  expensive  houses.  But  he  was  impressed.”  Bill  Aho                 remembered, “At that time, he didn’t have a nickel.”                       Jack then met Bill Aho’s son-in-law, Stuart Trusty, who had set up                 an  Internet  consultancy  called  Virtual  Broadcast  Network  (VBN),                  located in the U.S. Bank building on Fifth Avenue near Pike Street in                 downtown Seattle.                       “Jack  came  and  I  showed  him  what  the  Internet  was,”  Trusty                 recalled.  “Back  then,  the  Internet  was  largely  a  directory  for                 governments and businesses, but he seemed excited.”                       For Jack the visit to Seattle was a transformative experience: “It                 was  my  first  trip  to  the  States,  the  first  time  in  my  life  I  touched  a                 keyboard and computers, the first time in my life I connected to the                  Internet, and the first time I decided to leave as a teacher and start a                 company.”                       Jack recalled his first online session: “My friend Stuart . . . said,                 ‘Jack, this is Internet. You can find whatever you can find through the                 Internet.’ I say really? So I searched the word beer. Very simple word.                 I  don’t  know  why  I  searched  for  beer.  But  I  found  American  beer,                 Germany  [sic]  beer  and  no  Chinese  beer.  .  .  .  I  was  curious,  so  I                  searched ‘China,’ and no ‘China,’ no data.”                       Intrigued, Jack asked Stuart for help. “I talked to my friend, ‘Why                 don’t  I  make  something  about  China?’  So  we  made  a  small,  very                 ugly-looking page . . . [for the] translation agency I listed on there.”                       The site for Hope Translation was just text, without any images,                 plus a telephone number and the price for translation work.                       Jack  later  recalled  to  the  journalist  Charlie  Rose:  “It  was  so                 shocking, we launched it nine forty in the morning, twelve thirty I got a                  phone call from my friend. ‘Jack, you’ve got five emails.’ I said, ‘What                 is  email?’”  Three  emails  came  from  the  United  States,  one  from                 Japan, and one from Germany.                       Jack set about formulating the idea for a new business—helping                 Chinese  companies  find  export  channels  online—and  pitched  the                 idea of a partnership with VBN.                       Stuart,  who  developed  a  love  of  tai  chi  from  Jack—he  still                  practices  in  Atlanta  today—recalled  Jack  as  intensely  focused  on                 work.","“We’d  go  down  to  the  office,  we’d  do  our  work,  then  we’d  get                 something to eat, go back home maybe do more tai chi and it was                 just that way . . . every day. No extra curricular activities.”                       Jack’s  dealings  with  VBN  weren’t  easy.  Stuart  asked  for  an                                                       8                 upfront deposit of $200,000  to grant Jack the exclusive right to make                 Web  pages  in  China.  When  Jack  explained  that  he  had  borrowed                 money to make the trip to the United States and was now penniless,                 Stuart signed the agreement without the deposit but on the condition                 that Jack pay up as soon as possible, even enlisting Bill Aho and his                 wife as guarantors. To get home to Hangzhou, according to a local                  media report, Jack had to borrow funds from a Hangzhou student in                 the States, then flew to Shanghai.                       For his  client  in  Tonglu,  Jack returned  to China  empty-handed,                 with no deal to finance the proposed highway. But inside his suitcase                 he carried back with him a computer running the Intel 486 processor:                 “It was the most advanced in China at that time.”                       Back in Hangzhou he set about building his concept of an online                  yellow  pages.  He  named  the  business  China  Pages.  In  this,  his                 second venture, he would dive headfirst into the entrepreneurial sea,                 leaving his teaching days behind.","Chapter Five                                          China Is Coming On                            If traditional industry and e-commerce “successfully merge together,                  there will be no limit to China’s next round of economic development.”                                                        —Jack Ma                     Soon  after  returning  from  Seattle  to  Hangzhou,  Jack  resigned  his                 position  as  a  teacher  at  the  Hangzhou  Institute  of  Electronic                  Engineering. He had realized that his teaching days must end when                 he ran into the dean, who was riding his bicycle carrying vegetables                 he  had  just  bought  from  the  market.  The  dean  encouraged  him  to                 keep  working  hard  at  teaching,  but  looking  at  the  bicycle  and  the                 vegetables Jack realized that even if he were to become dean himself                 one day, this was a future he couldn’t get excited about.                       His new dream wasn’t teaching or translating. Fresh from his first                  contact with the Internet, he would build an online index, in English, of                 businesses in China seeking customers overseas.                       As  Stuart  Trusty  had  noticed  back  in  Seattle,  Jack  had  a                 tremendous  work  ethic.  To  populate  China  Pages  with  entries,  he                 toiled  away  collecting  information  on  companies,  which  he  would                 translate into English, then send along with photos to VBN in Seattle                 for uploading to the website.                       In March 1995, Jack convened a gathering of two dozen of his                  night school students to present his concept and seek their advice, as                 well as their business. “I asked the most active and capable people                 from my evening classes to my home. I talked about two hours, they                 listened to me, obviously confused. . . . Eventually lots of people cast                 their votes. Twenty-three of them said it would not work out. Only one                 person—now he is working at Agricultural Bank of China—said to me:","If you want to try, then go ahead, but if it doesn’t work out, come back                 as soon as you can.”                       Undeterred,  he  pressed  ahead.  Together  with  his  friend  He                 Yibing, a computer science teacher at the institute Jack had just left,                  Jack launched China Pages. The two had met the year before when                 He Yibing was looking for someone to help him practice his English                 ahead  of  a  training  trip  to  Singapore.  There,  He  Yibing  gained                 exposure  to  the  Internet.  When  Jack  returned  from  Seattle  with  a                 dream  of  building  an  Internet  company,  the  two  decided  to  work                 together.                     China Pages                  The company they registered, Hangzhou Haibo Network Consulting                 (HHNC), was one of the first in China devoted to the Internet. To fund                  his  start-up  Jack  borrowed  money  from  his  relatives,  including  his                 sister,  brother-in-law,  and  parents.  Jack’s  wife,  Cathy,  was  the  first                 employee.                       In  April  1995,  Jack  and  He  Yibing  opened  the  first  office  for                 China  Pages  in  a  twelve-square-meter  office  building  at  38  Wen’er                 Road.  To  portray  their  business  as  a  solid  concern,  Jack  and  He                 Yibing printed up several versions of their business cards, each listing                                         1                 different  positions   that  they  would  use  depending  on  whom  they                 were  meeting.  During  the  day,  the  two  partners  went  out  to  find                 clients,  returning  in  the  evening  to  teach  an  introductory  training                 course  about  the  “information  superhighway.”  This  class  helped                 generate some of China Pages’ early customers.                       On  May  10,  1995,  they  registered  the  domain  name                  chinapages.com in the United States. In July they officially launched                 their website, which featured a red-framed map of Asia, with China                 highlighted under the title “China Business Pages: The Online China                 Business Directory.”                       The  website’s  home  page  indicated  chinapages.com  was                 “Broadcast via Seattle, USA from Hangzhou, the Garden City.” The                 site  featured  tabs  including  “What’s  New!,”  “What’s  Cool!,”  “Net                 Search,”  and  “Net  Directory,”  and  a  link  to  Hope,  his  translation                 venture.","China Pages started off as a family affair. Jack’s wife, Cathy, her                 sister Zhang Jing, and He Yibing’s girlfriend all lent a hand.                       Jack’s  former  students  also  provided  a  ready  pool  of  talent  for                 China Pages. Jane Jiang (Jiang Fang), whom Jack had taught at the                  institute  a  few  years  earlier,  took  charge  of  customer  service.  One                 visitor to China Pages in those early days was Cui Luhai, who ran a                 computer animation business. Now a lecturer at the China Academy                 of  Art,  Cui  commented,  “I  can  still  remember  the  first  scene  I  saw                 when I walked into his office. . . . It was a pretty empty space with                 only one desk set up in the middle of the room. There was only one                 very old PC desktop surrounded by a lot of people.” Cui learned that                 Jack  had  spent  most  of  his  money  on  registering  the  business,                  leaving little leftover for hardware or other equipment.                       China Pages badly needed customers. Cathy signed up one of                 the  first  clients,  who  paid  them  eight  thousand  yuan  ($960).  The                 company received a boost when Hangzhou was selected in May to                 hold  the  Formula  One  Powerboat  World  Championship  later  that                 year, the first time the event would be held in China. Jack’s venture                 won the contract to make the official website for the race.                        To win more clients, as with Hope Translation beforehand, Jack                 called  on  his  former  students  to  spread  the  word  and  bring  in                 business. Two of them duly obliged.                       He  Xiangyang,  a  former  student  of  Jack’s,  was  working  at  the                 Qianjiang Law Firm. Reluctant to list the firm’s name on the Internet,                 he gave Jack his personal phone number instead. To his surprise, he                 started  to  receive  phone  calls  around  the  clock  from  prospective                 clients,  many  overseas,  who  told  him  they’d  got  his  number  from                  China Pages. The once-skeptical lawyer started to think there might                 be something to Jack’s story about the Internet after all.                       Another  former  student  was  Zhou  Lan,  who  would  become                 Jack’s  secretary.  Zhou  was  working  at  the  Lakeview  Hotel  in                 Hangzhou when Jack made a website for them, featuring the hotel’s                 brand-new  fourteen-inch  color  TVs.  Later  that  year,  the  United                 Nations  held  its  Fourth  World  Conference  on  Women  in  Beijing,                  attended  by  more  than  seventeen  thousand  participants,  including                 First  Lady  Hillary  Clinton.  A  number  of  delegates  traveled  on  to                 Hangzhou after the conference. Booking rooms at the Lakeview, they","told  the  hotel  management  it  was  the  only  hotel  in  Hangzhou  they                 could  find  online.  By  the  following  spring,  the  hotel  had  sold  more                 rooms  in  the  first  three  months  than  the  previous  year,  another                 demonstration of the power of the Internet.                        Even  with  the  help  of  Jack’s  former  students,  China  Pages                 needed  more  clients  if  it  was  going  to  survive.  But  demonstrating                 what  China  Pages  was  all  about  was  not  easy,  for  one  very  basic                 reason: In Hangzhou at the time it was impossible to get online.                       Instead  Jack  came  up  with  an  alternative  approach.  First,  he                 spread the word through friends and contacts about what the Internet                 could do for their business. He then asked those interested to send                 him marketing materials to introduce their companies and products.                  Next Jack and his colleagues translated the materials, and sent the                 material by mail to VBN in Seattle. VBN then designed the websites                 and  put  them  online.  They  then  printed  out  screenshots  of  the                 websites and mailed them to Hangzhou. Finally, Jack took the printed                 materials  to  his  friends  and  announced  that,  although  they  couldn’t                 check  this  themselves,  their  websites  were  now  online.  But  without                 Internet access in Hangzhou it was a challenge even explaining to his                  customers what “online” actually meant. As sales pitches go, asking                 people  who  had  never  heard  of  the  Internet  to  fork  over  20,000                 renminbi ($2,400) up front to create, design, and host a website they                 could  never  see  was  a  challenging  one.  Jack  worried  that  people                 thought  he  was  defrauding  them. “I was  treated  like  a con  man  for                 three years,” he said.                     First Connection                  Finally,  in  the  fall  of  1995,  Zhejiang  Telecom  started  to  provide                 Internet access services in Hangzhou. By the end of the year there                 were  only  204  Internet  users  in  the  whole  province.  But  Jack  was                  among them and was finally able to load a website in front of his first                 client,  the  Lakeview  Hotel,  on  the  486  computer  he’d  brought  back                 from  Seattle  in  his  suitcase.  “It  took  three  and  a  half  hours  to                 download the front page. . . . I was so excited.”                       Starting  with  Deng  Xiaoping’s  reforms,  China  experienced  an                 entrepreneurial explosion that began to replace Marx with the market,","becoming a socialist country “with Chinese characteristics.” But this                 did not mean the Communist Party was going to ease up on a central                 pillar of its rule, the control of information. China has a long tradition                 of  controlling  information,  but  especially  so  under  the  rule  of  the                  Communist  Party.  It  is  surprising,  therefore,  that  the  country  ever                 connected  to  the  Internet  at  all.  The  fact  that  it  did  illustrates  the                 Chinese government’s often contradictory desires to maintain control                 while simultaneously unlocking greater economic opportunities.                       Without  the  Internet,  Jack’s  vision  of  connecting  entrepreneurs                 with global markets would have never been realized.                       On September 14, 1987, while Jack was still a university student,                 the very first email from China was sent by Professor Qian Tianbai at                  Peking  University  to  Karlsruhe  University  in  what  was  then  West                 Germany. The email, in English and German, read, “Across the Great                 Wall we can reach every corner in the world.” The email was sent at                 300 bits per second (bps), an impossibly slow connection by today’s                 typical  consumer  broadband  speeds  measured  by  the  tens  or                 hundreds of millions of bps. It would be another seven years before                 China was connected to the Internet proper.                        While  the  Chinese  government  was  thinking  about  what  to  do                 about  the  Internet—wrestling  with  issues  of  ideology,  control,  and                 infrastructure—the  U.S.  government  was  pondering  the  wisdom  of                 bringing a communist country online. In the end, it was not politicians                                    2                 but scientists,  on both sides of the Pacific, who took the lead. After                 years  of  efforts,  the  Stanford  Linear  Accelerator  Center  (SLAC)  in                                                                3                 Menlo Park, California, connected  with the Institute of High Energy                 Physics (IHEP), 5,800 miles away in Beijing.                       While this was just a connection between two institutions, other                 scientists wanted to set up their own links. Connecting SLAC-IHEP to                 the Internet was a much easier solution than stringing up new links                  from other locations in the United States to IHEP. As Dr. Les Cottrell                 at  SLAC  recalled,  “We  explored  this  only  to  find  out  that  the  DOD                 [Department of Defense], the DOE [Department of Energy], the State                 Department  all  were  very concerned  about  this.” But eventually  the                 U.S. government agreed, “They said okay, you can do this as long as                 you tell everybody who is on the Internet that China’s coming on.”","Les wasn’t quite sure how to “tell everybody” on the Internet but                 eventually it was agreed that he would send an email to a particular                 distribution list. On May 17, 1994, the first real Internet connection to                 China was established.                        Although IHEP was host to China’s first Web pages, the Internet                 soon became more than a privilege reserved for particle physicists.                       At the same time as this first connection was being established,                 China  was  on  the  verge  of  a  massive  expansion  in  its                 communications  infrastructure,  a  policy  it  called  “informatization”                 (xinxihua). China’s communist rulers had watched the collapse of the                 Soviet Union in 1990 with alarm, attributing it in part to the yawning                 technological gap that had opened up with the United States. At the                  beginning of 1994 China had only 27 million phone lines and 640,000                 cell  phones  for  a  population  of  1.2  billion.  The  early  users  of  cell                 phones  were  either  government  officials  or  the  getihu  who  could                 afford  to  shell  out  $2,000  to  buy  one,  with  others  making  do  with                 pagers.                       The  Chinese  government  resolved  to  change  this,  seeing  an                 improvement in telecommunications as a tangible improvement they                  could  deliver  in  the  lives  of  the  masses.  Just  as  King  Henry  IV  of                 France cemented his legitimacy by putting a chicken on every dinner                 table  on  a  Sunday,  with  xinxihua  the  Chinese  Communist  Party                 began  to  roll  out  phone  lines,  then  cell  phones,  then  broadband                 connections to hundreds of millions of people.                       In  1993,  Vice  Premier  Zhu  Rongji  launched  the  Golden  Bridge                 Project  to  create  an  information  and  communications  network                 spanning  the  whole  country.  In  1994,  the  government  ended  the                  monopoly  of  telecom  services  held  by  the  Ministry  of  Posts  and                 Telecommunications  (MPT).  To  inject  some  competition  into  the                 market,  a  second  carrier,  called  China  Unicom,  was  established.                 Other countries, starting with the United Kingdom, had used private                 capital  to  finance  the  competitors  taking  on  state-owned  telecom                 incumbents.  China,  obsessed  with  control  of  information,  could  not                 contemplate this—twenty years on it still hasn’t—and opted instead to                  launch  China  Unicom  as  a  new  state-owned  enterprise,  backed  by                 three other ministries and a number of other state-owned enterprises,                 effectively  pitting  one  government  department  against  a  coalition  of","other  departments  in  a  uniquely  Chinese  approach  to  telecom                 deregulation.                       Spurred into action by the loss of its monopoly, the new minister                 of  MPT,  Wu  Jichuan,  responded  with  massive  new  investment  in                  telecom infrastructure.                       During  a  visit  by  U.S.  secretary  of  commerce  Ron  Brown  to                 Beijing  shortly  after  the  first  SLAC-IHEP  Internet  connection  was                 established, China signed an agreement with Sprint to set up a new                 Internet  connection  linking  Beijing  and  Shanghai  with  the  United                 States.  This  was  the  beginning  of  the  “ChinaNet”  Internet  service                 provider link that would allow members of the public, including Jack,                 to dial up to the Internet in China for the first time.                     China’s First Technology Entrepreneurs                   As  word  spread  that  China  was  finally  investing  in  its  telecom                 infrastructure,  the  country’s  first  technology  entrepreneurs  began  to                 emerge. Mostly U.S.-educated engineers, they started new ventures                 to help build out China’s communications networks. One of the most                 prominent  was  James  Ding  (Ding  Jian),  a  master’s  graduate  in                 information  science  from  the  University  of  California,  Los  Angeles.                 After  the  suppression  of  pro-democracy  protests  in  Tiananmen                 Square  in  June  1989,  he  and  many  other  U.S.-educated  Chinese                 instead shifted their hopes for radical political change in China to a                  faith  in  the  power  of  technology  to  reshape  the  country.  In  1993,                 James  Ding  joined  forces  with  Beijing-born  Edward  Tian  (Tian                 Suning),  who  had  recently  completed  a  Ph.D.  at  Texas  Tech,  to                 cofound AsiaInfo. In 1995, they moved the company’s operations to                 Beijing  to  work  on  the  data  network  buildout  for  China’s  telcos,                 including China Telecom’s ChinaNet dial-up Internet access network.                 Edward  Tian  would  go  on  to  become  a  leading  figure  in  China’s                  telecom market, and both he and James Ding would become high-                 profile investors in the technology sector.                       In 1995, another influential Chinese technology firm, UTStarcom,                 was formed. Started by Chinese and Taiwanese entrepreneurs in the                 United  States,  the  company  soon  set  up  its  China  operations  in                 Hangzhou. UTStarcom would play an important role in spurring the","growth  of  China’s  telecom  market  by  promoting  a  low-cost  mobile                 system  called  Little  Smart  (xiaolingtong).  This  success  helped  put                 Hangzhou on the map for investors as a technology hub.                       A key investor in UTStarcom in 1995 was the newly established                  Japanese investment fund SoftBank, a firm that five years later would                 start  to  play  a  critical  role  in  the  success  of  Alibaba.  Founded  by                 Japanese  billionaire  Masayoshi  Son,  SoftBank  took  a  30  percent                 stake in UTStarcom.                       UTStarcom was formed by the merger of Unitech Industries and                 Starcom  Network  Systems.  Unitech’s  Taiwanese  founder,  Lu                 Hongliang,  had  studied  with  Masayoshi  Son  at  the  University  of                 California, Berkeley. Starcom’s cofounder, Chauncey Shey, went on                  to head SoftBank China Venture Capital, which led Masayoshi Son’s                 investment in Alibaba in 2000.                       By  late  1995,  with  China’s  telecom  and  Internet  buildout                 beginning  to  gain  momentum,  Jack  and  his  customers  were  finally                 able to connect to the Internet from Hangzhou, using the ChinaNet                 service  that  had  already  been  rolled  out  in  Beijing,  Shanghai,  and                 Guangzhou. Soon after, Jack traveled back to the United States with                  Li Qi, his newly appointed chief engineer, to visit VBN in Seattle. On                 returning to China they ended their venture with VBN, setting up their                 own servers and a new China Pages site.                       This helped cut costs, but boosting revenues was proving hard.                 In  1995,  only  1.5  million  personal  computers  were  sold  in  China,                 mostly  to  business  or  government  users.  Priced  at  roughly  $1,800,                 the PCs cost a fortune for average Chinese at the time. The costs of                 getting a fixed line installed and getting online, combined with a lack                  of awareness about what the Internet actually was, meant that China                 Pages was having a hard time finding enough customers.                       Jack stepped up his efforts to evangelize the Internet. He even                 enlisted  Bill  Gates,  in  a  manner  of  speaking.  In  late  1995,  Gates’s                 book  The  Road  Ahead  became  an  instant  bestseller  in  the  United                 States  and  soon  after  in  China,  too.  Although  the  book  hardly                               4                 mentioned  the World Wide Web, to convince prospective clients of                 the  importance  of  the  Internet  Jack  started  citing  a  quote  from  Bill                 Gates:  “The  Internet  will  change  every  aspect  of  human  beings’                 lives.” A useful marketing message for China Pages, Jack had in fact","made it up, as he later confessed, “In 1995, the world started to know                 Bill Gates. But if I said, ‘Jack Ma says that the Internet will change                 every aspect of human beings’ lives,’ who would believe it?” But, he                 added,  “I  believed  that  Bill  Gates  would  definitely  say  it  one  day.”                  (Shortly after the book was released, Gates famously did realize the                 importance of the Internet, dramatically stepping up Microsoft’s efforts                 and  releasing  a  second  edition  of  the  book  with  a  much  greater                 emphasis on the Internet.)                       Meanwhile, in Beijing, an entrepreneur, Jasmine Zhang (Zhang                 Shuxin), had started to attract growing media interest after founding                 in  May  1995  one  of  China’s  first  privately  owned  Internet  service                 businesses.  She  called  her  venture  Yinghaiwei,  a  rough,  phonetic                  equivalent  in  Chinese  of  the  English  term  “Information  Highway.”                 Other China Internet founders credit her as the source of inspiration                 for starting their own ventures. One told me: “One day I was driving to                 work  and  saw  one  of  their  billboard  ads  saying,  ‘How  far  is  China                 away from the Information Highway? Fifteen hundred meters ahead,’”                 referring  to  the  company’s  office.  Building  on  a  tradition  of  internal                 BBS  (bulletin  board  systems),  popular  in  leading  academic                  institutions  such  as  Tsinghua  and  Peking  universities,  the  company                 started to serve a few hundred users keen to experience the Internet,                 then mostly dominated by websites in English, and share comments                 in Chinese about what they were discovering.                       Back  in  Hangzhou,  Jack  stepped  up  his  efforts  to  promote  his                 own  venture,  scoring  a  breakthrough  when  the  Zhejiang  provincial                 government invited China Pages to build its website. The government                 official  in  charge  of  commissioning  the  website,  Yang  Jianxin,  later                  recalled his dealings with Jack: “The first time he came to my office,                 frankly speaking, as I understood him to be an Internet guru I didn’t                 expect to meet such a young guy.” Jack launched enthusiastically into                 an explanation of the Internet. Yang recalled Jack talked “nonstop for                 two hours.” Although Yang indicated the government was unable to                 pay  for the project,  as its impact  was  unknown,  Jack and  his  team                 quickly built the site, hosted by China Pages, in cooperation with a                  local unit of Zhejiang Telecom called Hangzhou Dife Communications                 —a partnership that soon after would sour dramatically. The site was                                                                               5                 one of the first projects in a national initiative  to bring the Chinese","government online, generating a lot of publicity for Zhejiang. Within a                 few  days  Yang  received  congratulatory  emails  from  overseas,                                                                                 6                 including  from  members  of  the  U.S.  Congress.   The  coverage  also                                                                         7                 boosted Jack’s profile, a local newspaper  ran a feature story on his                 company and his dramatic first visit to the United States.                       But the publicity also triggered problems for Jack and the official                 who had commissioned him. One of Yang’s colleagues reported him                 to  the  provincial  government,  accusing  him  of  “hobnobbing  with  a                  getihu.”  The  disgruntled  colleague’s  report  thundered  that                 “government  information  dissemination  was  a  serious  issue,  how                 could it be handled and published via a getihu?”                       After encountering  resistance  at the local  level,  Jack started to                 spend  most  of  his  time  in  Beijing.  There  he  met  up  with  Jasmine                 Zhang of Yinghaiwei. The two did not hit it off, Jack later sharing his                 first  impressions:  “I  though  if  the  Internet’s  demise  comes  one  day,                  hers will be earlier than mine. I was already very idealistic, but here                 was someone who was even more idealistic than me.”                       Jack and his partner, He Yibing, set about raising the profile of                 China Pages in Beijing. Jack had brought with him some articles he                 had written about the Internet, and asked his friends to help publish                 them.  In  Beijing,  thanks  to  a  relationship  with  a  driver  at  the                 publication  who  was  introduced  by  a  friend,  he  met  Sun  Yanjun,                 deputy editor in chief of China Trade News. Sun was impressed by                  China Pages and invited Jack to give a lecture about the Internet to                 his  colleagues.  Afterward  he  published  a  front-page  article  on  Jack                 and his company.                       While  Jack  was  good  at  gaining  publicity,  China  Pages  still                 wasn’t winning much business, and its efforts to open doors with the                 central  government  came  to  naught.  In  July  1996,  China’s  national                 broadcaster,  China  Central  Television,  broadcast  a  documentary                  called Ma Yun the Scholar, which showed Jack being rebuffed by a                 government official. The documentary was produced by Fan Xinman,                 married  to  the  famous  director  Zhang  Jizhong,  who  has  brought  a                 number  of  Jin  Yong  novels  to  the  screen.  Fan  was  also  from                 Hangzhou  and  sympathetic  to  Jack’s  cause.  As  she  filmed  Jack                 getting shown the cold shoulder, Fan became increasingly concerned                 for Jack’s prospects: “He no longer had his base in Hangzhou, and","was crushed in Beijing. He was almost bankrupt.” In the documentary,                 through  a  window  to  the  Beijing  streets  outside,  Jack  made  a                 resolution to himself: “In a few years, you won’t treat me like this; in a                 few years, you will all know what I do. And I won’t be in dire straits in                  Beijing.”                       The  problem  for  China  Pages  was  that  it  really  was  just  a                 directory.  The  site  was  pretty  rudimentary,  merely  listings  of  a                 company’s  products  for  sale.  There  was  no  way  for  prospective                 customers  to make  purchases  online,  so  there  was  a  limit  on  what                 China Pages could charge for its services.              8                     Squeezed Out                   China Pages was running out of cash to meet its payroll. Switching                 sales staff to commission-based pay relieved the pressure for a while,                 as did a 10,000-yuan contract from a client in the textile industry. But                 China Pages was in a vulnerable state. Yet things were about to get                 much  worse.  The  company  that  had  worked  with  China  Pages  to                 build      the     Zhejiang       government          website,       Hangzhou          Dife                 Communication, made a bid to take over the company. China Pages                 was a small, privately owned company, but Hangzhou Dife was a unit                 of  a  powerful  SOE,  Zhejiang  Telecom.  In  February  1996  the  two                  entered into a joint-venture, Dife-Hope. Dife had a 70 percent stake in                 the  venture,  investing  1.4  million  renminbi  ($170,000).  Jack  would                 remain  the  general  manager  and  China  Pages  would  hold  the                 remaining  30  percent,  which  was  valued  at  600,000  renminbi                 ($70,000). At the time, this seemed like a significant achievement for                 a  tiny,  cash-strapped  company.  Zhang  Xinjian,  then  an  official  with                 Hangzhou  Telecom,  termed  it  the  first  merger  and  acquisition                                                                                                9                 transaction  in  the  history  of  China’s  Internet;  local  media  provided                 positive coverage of the joint venture.                       But the reality was a lot more sinister. Jack had discovered that                 when working with China Pages on the Zhejiang government website,                 Dife had registered the domain name www.chinesepages.com, very                 similar  to  his  own  venture’s  www.chinapages.com,  and  a  new                  company  called  “China  Yellow  Pages.”  Yet  because  Dife  was  a                 subsidiary  of  a  powerful  SOE,  Jack  couldn’t  fight  back.  Gritting  his","teeth  he  had  to  give  interviews  with  local  media  lauding  the  new                 venture:  “The  establishment  of  Dife-Haibo  will  further  strengthen                 China  Pages.”  He  concluded  by  saying,  “We  have  every  reason  to                 believe, with the right policies of the Party and the State, and with the                  tremendous  support  from  every  walk  of  life  in  the  society,  China                 Pages  will  surely  achieve  great  success.  China’s  information  high-                 speed train will be faster and faster!”                       Years later, after Alibaba had become successful, Jack was free                 to comment on the experience. China Pages was dwarfed by its new                 partner, and while Jack was the general manager, the position turned                 out to be of little value. “When the joint venture was formed, disaster                 followed.  They  had  five  votes  on  the  board,  and  we  had  two.                  Whenever there was a board meeting, whatever ideas I put forward, if                 one  of them voted  against  it, the rest of them followed  suit. During                 five or six board meetings, none of our ideas were passed.”                       Jack  had  lost  control  of  his  pioneering  venture:  “At  that  time  I                 called myself a blind man riding on the back of blind tigers. Without                 knowing  anything  about  technology  or  computers,  I  started  the  first                 company. And after years of terrible experience, we failed.”                        The  China  Pages  episode  provided  him  with  some  important                 lessons,  as  well  as  good  material  for  his  speeches,  such  as,  “It  is                 difficult for an elephant to trample an ant to death, as long as you can                 dodge well,” and “With good strategies, you will definitely survive. To                 this day, I’ve realized one thing: Don’t be nervous if you face huge                 competition  in  the  future.”  He  would  later  draw  on  his  experiences                 when  taking  Alibaba  into  battle  against  eBay,  in  the  David  versus                 Goliath struggle that would raise his profile on the global stage.                        Jack also points to China Pages as influencing the way he would                 structure his subsequent ventures: “From then on, I have held a firm                 belief:  When  I  start  businesses  in  future,  I  will  never  hold  the                 controlling stake of a company, making those controlled by me suffer.                 I will give plenty of understanding and support to lower levels. I have                 never once had a controlling stake at Alibaba. I am proud of this. I am                 the  CEO  of  the  company,  because  I  lead  it  with  [my]  wisdom,                  courage, and resourcefulness, not capital.”                       In November 1997, Jack convened an off-site meeting with the                 China Pages team in Tonglu, announcing that he was giving up his","stake in China Pages and moving to Beijing, leaving his partner He                 Yibing as CEO.                       Jack’s invented quote that the Internet would change everything                 was right. The problem was he had launched his venture too soon.                  Jack put his dreams on hold, taking a job in Beijing at a unit of the                 Ministry  of  Foreign  Trade  and  Economic  Cooperation  (MOFTEC).                 There he was like a fish out of water, counting the days until he could                 jump back into the entrepreneurial sea of China’s Internet, which was                 about to get a whole lot bigger.","Chapter Six                                             Bubble and Birth                            Alibaba might as well be known as “1,001 mistakes.” But there were                  three main reasons why we survived. We didn’t have any money, we                            didn’t have any technology, and we didn’t have a plan.                                                         —Jack Ma                    Third time lucky. After his struggles with Hope Translation and China                  Pages  and  an  uncomfortable  period  working  for  the  government  in                 Beijing, Jack went on to found Alibaba at the beginning of 1999. But                 extricating himself from China Pages and then from his government                 job  cost  him  two  years.  Meanwhile,  other  Internet  entrepreneurs  in                 China began to gain traction. Without a venture of his own Jack was                 running the risk of becoming irrelevant.                       Just as Jack had lost control of China Pages to his SOE-linked                  partner, in Beijing Jasmine Zhang had been forced out of Yinghaiwei                 by  her  largest  shareholder,  rumored  to  be  connected  with  China’s                 Ministry of State Security. Other entrepreneurs, especially those who                 had set up Internet service providers (ISPs) to roll out dial-up services                 to consumers,  found  themselves  squeezed  out  by  large  SOEs  like                 China Telecom. Yun Tao from Beijing-based ISP Cenpok summed it                      1                 up:  “It is not yet possible to make money in China on the Internet. . .                 . I have been at it for the last few years and I tell you, I am bleeding                 now.”                       While the telecom SOEs were actively protecting their turf from                 encroachment  by  the  private  sector,  China’s  state-owned  media                 companies  proved  surprisingly  incapable  of  competing  with                 entrepreneurs  building  out  Internet  content  businesses.  A  new                  generation of Internet entrepreneurs was coming to the fore in China,","inspired by Yahoo, the most influential company of the dot-com boom                 gaining speed in the United States.                       Listed  in  1996,  Yahoo  at  first  commanded  little  attention  from                 investors.  They  preferred  established  technology  companies,  which                  they  could  value  with  traditional  measures  such  as  price/earning                 ratios  (P/E  ratios).  But  Yahoo  and  its  generation  of  dot-com                 companies were years from becoming profitable. Fortune magazine’s                 Joe Nocera later summed up the valuation challenge: “You can’t have                 a P/E ratio when you have no ‘E.’” But all of this started to change in                 the summer of 1998. Yahoo’s shares ran up more than 80 percent in                 just  five  weeks,  taking  the  company’s  valuation  to  $9  billion  and                 making  billionaires  of  its  Stanford  cofounders,  Jerry  Yang  (Yang                  Zhiyuan in Chinese) and David Filo. The dot-coms that had sprouted                 up in Silicon Valley now suddenly were the center of attention for Wall                 Street, too.                       In China, the Taiwan-born Jerry Yang became a hero. The public                 was fascinated to learn how an immigrant to the United States had                 become a billionaire before the age of thirty.                       Suddenly  there  was  a  flurry  of  interest  in  Yahoo’s  “portal”                  business model, its directories and search engine connecting users to                 the rapidly expanding universe of online content. Chinese portals, or                 men  hu  (literally  “gateway”)  began  to  appear.  A  triumvirate  soon                 emerged as the country’s “portal pioneers”: Wang Zhidong, Charles                 Zhang, and William Ding. Unlike Jack, they had all excelled at their                 studies  and  had  strong  technical  backgrounds.  The  firms  they                 founded were Sina, Sohu, and NetEase.                     Portal Pioneers                  Wang Zhidong, the founder of Sina, was already well known, famous                 for  having  created  several  popular  Chinese  language  software                  applications—BD  Win,  Chinese  Star,  and  RichWin—that  helped                 people in China use the Microsoft Windows operating system. Born in                 1967 to poor but well-educated parents in south China’s Guangdong                 Province, Wang excelled in math and science. He secured a place at                 Peking University, where he studied radio electronics. In 1997, Wang                 was the first of the three portal pioneers to raise significant outside","investment—nearly $7 million—for his firm, Stone Rich Sight, based                 on his proven track record as a software developer. In the summer                 1998  he  launched  a  dedicated  website  featuring  soccer  results  in                 time for the FIFA World Cup held that year in France. This generated                  a lot of traffic, and the company shifted its focus from software to the                 Internet, later merging with another company to become Sina.                       Charles  Zhang  (Zhang  Chaoyang),  the  founder  of  Sohu,  was                 born  in  Xi’an.  One  month  younger  than  Jack,  he  won  entry  to                 Tsinghua  University  to  study  physics  before  heading  on  to  the                 Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). After attaining a Ph.D.                 in physics, Charles stayed on as a postdoc, working to foster U.S.-                 China relations through MIT’s Industrial Liaison Program. Inspired by                  the success of Netscape and Yahoo, Charles decided to launch his                 own Internet company. His original plan was to launch it in the United                 States, but as a recent Chinese immigrant he felt excluded from the                 mainstream,  including  being  unable  to  attract  the  interest  of  the                 media—something unlike the two other media-shy portal founders—                 he  was  particularly  attached  to.  “I  constantly  thought  I  was  an                 outsider. For example, here [in China] I receive interview invitations,                  but in the States I would probably never have been able to be on their                 news shows. So I came back.”                       Charles returned to Beijing in 1996. He set up his company with                 the  encouragement  and  financial  support  of  two  MIT  professors,                 including Ed Roberts, who at the time of Sohu’s IPO four years later                 held  a  5  percent  stake.  Charles  was  the  sole  returning  student,                 known  as  “sea  turtle”  (haigui)  of  the  three  pioneers.  His  greater                 exposure to the U.S. technology scene gave Charles a head start. In                  February  1998  he  was  the  first  of  the  three  to  launch  a  Chinese-                 language  search  engine  and  a  website  directly  inspired  by  Yahoo,                 even down to the name he chose for his venture: Sohoo.com, later                 changing the name to Sohu.com.                       William  Ding  (Ding  Lei)  was  born  in  Ningbo,  seven  years  after                 Jack.  He  studied  computer  science  in  a  technology  university  in                 Chengdu. After returning home to Ningbo to work for the local branch                  of China Telecom, William moved to Guangzhou in southern China to                 work  for  the  U.S.  database  company  Sybase,  then  for  a  local                 technology firm. In 1997 he launched his own venture, which rolled","out  the  first  free,  bilingual  email  service  in  China.  William’s  venture                 soon became profitable with the income generated by licensing the                 email  software  to  other  companies.  In  the  summer  of  1998  William                 switched his business from software development to the Internet and                  launched  his  website  NetEase.com.  Initially  popular  in  southern                 China,  NetEase  quickly  signed  up  email  users  all  over  the  country,                 1.4 million by the end of 1999.                       While  Wang  Zhidong,  Charles,  and  William  were  surfing  the                 waves of China’s exciting new dot-com sea, Jack was languishing on                 the  dusty  dot-gov  shore.  His  job  title  was  general  manager  of                 Infoshare Technology, a company set up by the China International                                                                     2                 Electronic Commerce Center (CIECC),  itself a unit of a department                 of  MOFTEC.  At  CIECC  Jack  led  the  development  of  MOFTEC’s                 official website, www.moftec.gov.cn, which launched in March 1998.                 Calling  some  of  his  China  Pages  colleagues  to  join  him  in  Beijing,                 Jack       then       developed          another       website        for      MOFTEC,                 www.chinamarket.com.cn, which launched on July 1, 1998.                        The  China  Market  site,  which  listed  more  than  eight  thousand                 commodities divided into six categories, invited visitors to post supply                 and  demand  information  and  enter  into  “confidential  business                 negotiations  in  encrypted  Business  ChatRooms.”  The  new  site                 attracted  the  praise  of  government  officials,  including  MOFTEC                 minister  Shi  Guangsheng,  who  called  it  a  “solid  step  by  China  to                 move into the age of e-commerce.” The official Chinese government                 news  agency,  Xinhua,  commended  the  site  for  its  “information                  reliability  and  orderly  operation,”  with  all  visitors  vetted  by  the                 government to ensure that they were valid businesses.                       The reality, though, was that all the offline bureaucracy involved                 in  registering  on  the  website  made  it  unappealing  to  businesses,                 especially  because  the  website  could  not  facilitate  any  orders  or                 payments. In other words it was just a bigger and government-backed                 version of China Pages. Jack fervently believed in the unfolding age                  of  e-commerce,  but  he  also  knew  that  the  future  belonged  to                 entrepreneurs, later recalling that “it was too tiring doing e-commerce                 in  the  government.  .  .  .  E-commerce  should  start  with  private                 enterprises.” Working for CIECC, Jack was buried by the many layers","of government officials above him, including Xing Wei, his fierce boss                 at CIECC.     3                        Jack  became  increasingly  frustrated  as  he  watched  the                 triumvirate  of  portal  pioneers  gain  momentum:  “Here  I  was,  I  had                 been  practicing  for  five  years  in  the  Internet  field,”  Jack  recalled.                 “Everything was changing very quickly. If I stayed in Beijing I couldn’t                 do  something  really  big;  I  couldn’t  realize  my  dreams  as  a  public                 servant.”                       But  his  government  perch  ended  up  giving  Jack  another  lucky                 break: his first encounter with Jerry Yang, the cofounder of Yahoo. In                  the coming years, the fates of Jack Ma and Jerry Yang would become                 ever more closely intertwined.                       As  the  general  manager  of  Infoshare,  and  a  fluent  English                 speaker, Jack was asked to receive Jerry Yang and his colleagues,                 who in late 1997 came to Beijing to look for opportunities for Yahoo in                 China. Jack’s experience as a self-appointed tour guide in Hangzhou                 came  in  handy  now  in  Beijing  since  Jerry  was  traveling  with  his                  younger brother Ken, and was keen to see some of the sights. Jack                 introduced him to his wife, Cathy, and they took Jerry, Jerry’s brother,                 and Yahoo vice president Heather Killen to visit Beihai Park, opposite                 the Forbidden City, and the Great Wall. Here they took a photo that                 would play an important role in helping separate Jack from the pack,                 illustrating Jack’s early meeting with the global king of the Internet at                 the time.","Jack as Jerry’s tour guide at the Great Wall. Heather Killen","Jack; his boss, Xing Wei; Jerry Yang; and Heather Killen in front of a photograph of then                                             President Jiang Zemin. Heather Killen                        On the visit Jack also took Jerry and Heather to meet the vice                 minister  of  MOFTEC.  Jack’s  charm  offensive  paid  off.  In  October                 1998, Infoshare was appointed the exclusive sales agent for Yahoo in                 China.                       But  Jack  was  already  actively  planning  to  slip  free  of  the                 constraints of government. Back at the Great Wall, Jack organized an                  off-site  meeting  with  some  of  his  Infoshare  colleagues,  an  outing                 since feted by the company as the unofficial launch of Alibaba. But                 Jack was worried about the consequences for him and his planned                 new venture of walking out of his government job. A friend advised                 Jack to feign illness, a common ruse in China to escape from such                 predicaments.  Jack  did  in  fact  come  down  with  appendicitis  a  few                 months later, but by then he was already back in Hangzhou and his                  new venture was well under way.                                        Jack and some of the cofounders of Alibaba at the Great Wall of China in late 1998. The                                   company would be launched a few months later. Alibaba","What’s in a Name                  Jack decided to call his new venture Alibaba, a curious name for a                 Chinese company.                       Jack has been asked many times why he chose an Arabic name                 for his company rather than something derived from his passion for                  Chinese martial arts or folklore. Jack was attracted, he said, by the                 “open  sesame”  imagery,  since  he  hoped  to  achieve  an  opening  for                 the  small-  and  medium-size  enterprises  he  was  targeting.  He  was                 also looking for a name that traveled well, and Alibaba is a name that                 is easy to pronounce in many languages. He liked the name since it                 came  at  the  beginning  of  the  alphabet:  “Whatever  you  talk  about,                  Alibaba is always on top.”                       In  China,  a  song  titled  “Alibaba  Is  a  Happy  Young  Man”  was                                                                                                 4                 popular  at  the  time,  but  Jack  says  the  idea  came  to  him   for  the                 website  on  a  trip  to  San  Francisco:  “I  was  having  lunch,  and  a                 waitress came. I asked her: ‘Do you know about Alibaba?’ She said,                 ‘Yes!’  ‘What  is  Alibaba?’  And  she  said,  ‘Open  Sesame.’  So  I  went                 down  to  the  street  and  asked  about  ten  to  twenty  people.  They  all                  [knew] about Alibaba, Forty Thieves, and Open Sesame. I think, this                 is a good name.”                       But  there  was  a  problem.  The  domain  name  alibaba.com  was                 registered to a Canadian man who was asking for $4,000 to transfer it                 over, a transaction that involved some risk if he didn’t hold up his side                                                                       5                 of  the  bargain.  So  Jack  launched   the  Alibaba  site  using                 alibabaonline.com and alibaba-online.com instead. Alibaba cofounder                 Lucy  Peng  recalled  how  the  early  team  members  had  joked  they                 were working for “AOL,” short for “Alibaba Online.”                       Jack soon after decided to buy the alibaba.com domain name.                          6                 Alibaba executive vice chairman Joe Tsai later recounted to me that                  Jack was nervous about wiring funds to the Canadian owner before                 he  could  be  assured  of  gaining  control  (a  problem  that  the  escrow                 function  of  Alipay  would  later  solve):  “He  didn’t  have  that  kind  of                 money,  so  was  scrounging  around.  But  Jack  is  a  very  savvy                 businessman,  he  has  that  innate  ability  to  say,  ‘All  right,  I’m  gonna                 trust this guy.’ A lot of entrepreneurs don’t trust other people.” Jack                  went  ahead  with  the  wire  transfer  to  the  Canadian,  who  (true  to","national  stereotypes)  proved  honest,  and  Jack  gained  control  of                 alibaba.com.                       The widespread recognition of the Alibaba name has saved Jack                 a lot of money in marketing expenses and a ready supply of imagery                  such as the forty thieves, and 1,001 nights, and other elements he                 still often incorporates into his speeches.                     Lakeside Gardens                  Alibaba was launched in Hangzhou by Jack’s friends, supporters, and                                                                                                     7                 colleagues, including some who joined him from China Pages  and                 Infoshare.                       Jack convened a meeting on February 21, 1999, at his Lakeside                  Gardens (Hupan Huayuan) apartment in Hangzhou. Confident in his                 future  success,  he  arranged  for  the  meeting  to  be  filmed.  With  the                 team seated around him in a semicircle, some wearing coats to fend                 off the damp cold inside the chilly apartment, Jack asked his converts                 to ponder the question: “In the next five to ten years, what will Alibaba                 become?” Answering his own question, he said that “our competitors                 are not in China, but in Silicon Valley. . . . We should position Alibaba                 as an international website.”                       The reality was that Jack, late to the portal game now dominated                  by Sina, Sohu, and NetEase, had to find his own niche in the China                 Internet  market.  The  portals  were  trying  to  capture  the  growing                 number of individual users coming online, but Jack was going to stick                 with  what  he  knew  best:  small  businesses.  In  contrast  to  the                 business-to-business sites in the United States that were focused on                 large  companies,  Jack  decided  to  focus  on  the  “shrimp.”  He  found                  inspiration  from  his  favorite  movie,  Forrest  Gump,  in  which  Gump                 makes  a  fortune  from  fishing  shrimp  after  a  storm:  “American  B2B                 [business-to-business] sites are whales. But 85 percent of the fish in                 the  sea  are  shrimp-sized.  I  don’t  know  anyone  who  makes  money                 from whales, but I’ve seen many making money from shrimp.”","Jack with other cofounders and supporters of Alibaba in the Lakeside Gardens apartment in                                             Hangzhou, October 30, 1999. Alibaba                        When  Jack  created  Alibaba  in  early  1999  China  had  only  two                 million  Internet  users.  But  this  would  double  in  six  months,  then                 double  again,  reaching  nine  million  by  the  end  of  the  year.  By  the                 summer of 2000 there were 17 million online.                       Personal computers still cost a hefty $1,500, but prices began to                 fall as new market entrants like Dell set up shop in competition with                  homegrown  companies  Founder,  Great  Wall,  and  Legend  (later                 rebranded  as  Lenovo).  Sales  of  new  PCs,  still  going  mostly  to                 businesses or government users, hit five million in 1999.                       The  government’s  policy  of  “informatization”  was  making  the                 Internet more affordable. Getting a connection from the local phone                 company still took months and could cost as much as $600. But in                  March 1999 the government scrapped the installation fee for second                                                                           8                 phone  lines  and  made  it  cheaper  to  surf   online,  too,  cutting  the                 average price from $70 per month in 1997 to only $9 by the end of                 1999.                       Millions of young, educated people were coming online at their                 colleges or workplaces, others at the thousands of Internet cafés that                 were  mushrooming  across  the  country.  Yahoo’s  business  model  in                  the United States was to make money from the growing market for                 online advertising. The three China portals in turn planned to grab a                                                                                 9                 piece of a fast-growing online advertising cake,  which grew to $12                 million in 1999 from only $3 million the year before. But even in the                  States  Yahoo  was  losing  money,  and  in  China  the  bulk  of  Internet                 users had little disposable income to excite advertisers. The potential","revenues for the portals were way below their expenditures. Yet in the                 upside-down  logic  of  the  unfolding  dot-com  boom,  losses  were  not                 only acceptable but worn as a badge of honor: the bigger the loss,                 the grander a firm’s ambition. Venture capital (VC) firms were there to                  bridge the gap.                       Before  Alibaba  was  even  out  of  the  starting  gate,  Sina,  Sohu,                 and  NetEase  had  started  to  win  the  backing  of  VCs,  competing                 aggressively for new users and investment.                             10                       Sina   was  formed  by  the  December  1998  merger  of  Wang                 Zhidong’s firm SRS with the U.S. company Sinanet, founded by three                                               11                 Taiwan-born students  at Stanford University. Daniel Mao, an early                 investor in SRS at the Walden International Investment Group, helped                 broker  the  merger.  Sina.com  was  launched  in  April  1999  and  the                 following  month  raised  $25  million  in  VC  from  investors,  including                 Goldman Sachs, Walden, and Japan’s SoftBank.                                                                                          12                       Sohu raised $10 million in 1998 and more funding  the following                 year  on  the  back  of  soaring  traffic  on  its  Chinese-language  search                 engine. Founder Charles Zhang was relishing his newfound celebrity                 status in China, and he brought on Stanford-educated returnee Victor                 Koo  (who  later  left  to  found  Youku,  China’s  answer  to  YouTube)  to                 beef  up  Sohu’s  management.  He  also  tried,  unsuccessfully,  to  hire                  Jack as his COO.                       NetEase was the last of the three portals to raise VC funding for                 the simple reason that founder William Ding didn’t really need to: He                 could count on a steady flow of licensing revenues from the webmail                 software  he  had  personally  developed.  William  Ding  had  by far the                 highest equity stake of any portal founder—58.5 percent—when his                 company went public in 2000.                        Watching  from  the  sidelines,  Jack  realized  he  would  have  to                 hustle if he was to ever catch the attention of VCs or catch up with                 the  portal  pioneers  who  were  speeding  off  into  the  distance.  For                 Alibaba  to  thrive  he  would  have  to  foster  a  relentless  work  ethic,                 ensuring  a  clean  break  from  the  bureaucratic  culture  that  he  and                 some of his colleagues had just left behind in Beijing. Jack exhorted                 the group assembled in his apartment to “learn the hard working spirit                 of Silicon Valley . . . If we go to work at 8 A.M. and get off work at 5","P.M.,  this  is  not  a  high-tech  company,  and  Alibaba  will  never  be                 successful.”                       Jack likes to put Silicon Valley companies on a pedestal, but he                 also likes to rally his team by saying Alibaba could knock them off it:                  “Americans are strong at hardware and systems but in software and                 information  management,  Chinese  brains  are  just  as  good  as                 American. . . . I believe that one of us can be worth ten of them.”                       Alibaba  was  formed  at  a  time  when  the  inflating  dot-com                 valuations made even his loyal converts nervous about whether the                 bubble  would  soon  burst.  Speaking  to  them  in  his  apartment  Jack                 sought to reassure them: “Has the Internet reached its peak? Have                 we done enough? Is it too late for us to follow? . . . Don’t worry. I don’t                  think the dream of the Internet will burst. We will have to pay a very                 painful price in the next three to five years. It is the only way we can                 succeed  in  the  future.”  To  rally  the  troops,  Jack  set  a  goal  of                 achieving  an  IPO  within  three  years.  “Once  we  become  a  listed                 company,  what  each  and  every  one  of  us  will  gain  .  .  .  is  not  this                 apartment, but fifty apartments like this. We are just charging forward.                 Team spirit is very, very important. When we charge forward, even if                  we lose, we still have the team. We still have each other to support.                 What on earth are you afraid of?”                       Although  Jack and  Cathy  together  were  the lead  shareholders,                 Alibaba  was  cofounded  by  a  total  of  eighteen  people,  six  of  whom                 were  women.  None  came  from  privileged  backgrounds,  prestigious                                 13                 universities,   or  famous  companies.  This  was  a  team  of  “regular                 people,”  bound  together  by  Jack’s  energy  and  his  unconventional                 management methods. To build team spirit, Jack drew on his love of                 Jin  Yong’s  novels  and  gave  each  of  his  Alibaba  team  members                 nicknames.  His  own  nickname  was  Feng  Qingyang.  In  Jin  Yong’s                                         14                 book Swordsman,  Feng is a reclusive sword and kung fu master,                 preparing young apprentices to be heroes. As a former teacher, Jack                                                                                           15                 identified with Feng and his “unpredictable yet nurturing”  character.                    Joe Tsai Comes to Hangzhou                                                                16                 In  May  1999,  Jack  met  Joe  Tsai,  a Taiwanese-born  investor  then                 living in Hong Kong. Joe would become Jack’s right-hand man, a role","he  still  performs  more  than  seventeen  years  later.  The  association                 between  the  two  would  become  one  of  the  most  profitable  and                 enduring partnerships in Chinese business.                       Jack takes pride in being “one hundred percent Made in China.”                  Yet, starting with Joe Tsai, a number of “Born in Taiwan” individuals                 would  make  major  contributions  to  Alibaba’s  success,  just  as  they                 have to many technology companies in Silicon Valley.                       I  first  met  Joe  at  the  beginning  of  Alibaba’s  journey  in  1999,                 shortly  after  he’d  joined.  In  the  spring  of  2015,  I  traveled  back  to                 Hangzhou to understand what prompted Joe to take such a gamble                 on  Jack.  Although  the  two  men  were  born  in  the  same  year,  they                  could hardly be more different. Joe came from a prestigious family                       17                 and he had a top-tier academic and professional background.                       At the age of thirteen, speaking hardly any English, Joe was sent                                                                                             18                 off  from  Taiwan  to  the  Lawrenceville  School,  an  elite   boarding                 school in New Jersey. There Joe excelled at his studies as well as at                 lacrosse, which he credits with helping him assimilate into American                 culture  and  learn  the  importance  of  working  in  a  team:  “The  sport                 taught  me  life  lessons  about  teamwork  and  perseverance.  While  I                 never  got  past  playing  on  the  third  midfield  line,  being  part  of  the                 team was the best experience of my life.”                       Joe won entrance to Yale College, where he studied economics                 and East Asian studies, and proceeded on to Yale Law School. After                  graduating he began his career in New York with the storied law firm                 Sullivan \& Cromwell and a short stint at a management buyout firm.                 But Joe wanted to gain investment experience in Asia. He moved to                 Hong Kong to work for Investor AB, the investment arm of Sweden’s                 powerful Wallenberg family. As the dot-com boom gained momentum,                 Joe  starting  looking  out  for  opportunities  to  team  up  with  an                 entrepreneur.                        I asked Joe how he came to connect with Jack: “I wanted to be                 more  intimately  involved  in  technology  start-ups.  Because  I  was                 making  investments  for  Investor,  sitting  on  boards,  I  always  felt  a                 layer of distance between the board and the management. I said to                 myself, I should be involved in the operation.”                       Joe  first  heard  about  Jack  from  family  friend  Jerry  Wu,  a                 Taiwanese  businessman  who  ran  a  communications  start-up.  After","Jerry came back from Hangzhou he contacted Joe, telling him, “You                 have  to  go  and  meet  this  guy  Jack  Ma  in  Hangzhou.  He’s  kind  of                 crazy. He’s got a big vision.”                       Wu  was  hoping  Alibaba  might  take  over  his  struggling  start-up                  and asked Joe for his help.                       Joe  agreed  and  hopped  on  a  plane  from  Hong  Kong  to                 Hangzhou  to  meet  Jack  in  the  Lakeside  Gardens  apartment.  “I  still                 can remember the first sight of the apartment. It reminded me of my                 grandmother’s  apartment  in  Taipei.  When  you  walked  into  the                 building, the stairway was old and narrow. About ten pairs of shoes                 were in front of the apartment. It was a smelly place. I was in a suit. It                 was May—hot and humid.”                        Joe remembers how Jack outlined his ambitious goal for Alibaba:                 to help millions of Chinese factories find an outlet overseas for their                 goods. The factory owners lacked the skills to market their products                 themselves  and,  Jack  explained,  had  little  choice  but  to  sell  their                 goods through state-owned trading companies. Jack was proposing                 to cut out the middleman, always a compelling idea.                       Joe was intrigued by Jack as he talked, “sitting backwards in a                  chair, clapping, like someone from a kung fu novel.” Listening intently                 as  Jack  switched  effortlessly  in  and  out  of  fluent  English.  Joe  was                 impressed. This guy is good! he thought to himself.                       When Jack spoke Mandarin he did so in an accent that reminded                 Joe of his own grandfather, whose ancestral home was in Huzhou,                                        19                 near  Hangzhou.   Speaking  in  Mandarin,  Joe  had  started  the                 conversation  by  apologizing  to  Jack  that  he  couldn’t  speak  the                 Hangzhou dialect. Thinking that it might help establish a rapport, Joe                 added, “I do speak Shanghainese. My parents grew up in Shanghai.”                 Looking back on that first meeting, Joe laughs. “I hadn’t realized that                 Hangzhou people hated Shanghainese. They think they are too sly,                 too commercial, too money-oriented. Later on Jack told me that there                 are three kinds of people he doesn’t trust: Shanghainese, Taiwanese,                  and  Hong  Kong  people.”  But  somehow  Jack  and  Joe,  a                 Shanghainese-speaking Taiwanese who lived in Hong Kong, hit it off.                 “It was fate that the two of us ended up working together.”                       Joe  flew  back  to  Hong  Kong  and  shared  his  excitement  about                 Jack and Alibaba with his wife, Clara. But trading a well-paying job in","Hong Kong for a start-up in Hangzhou was a big risk, especially since                        20                 Clara  was expecting their first child. So Clara suggested she travel                 with Joe back to Hangzhou.                       Jack  remembers  their  visit.  Clara  told  him  she  wanted  to  see                 Alibaba because her husband was crazy about it: “If I agree with him,                 then I am crazy. But if I don’t agree, he will hate me his whole life.”                       Joe too was thinking carefully before taking the plunge. “I went                 back a second time because I saw something in Jack. Not just the                 vision,  the  sparks  in  his  eyes.  But  a  team  of  people,  his  loyal                 followers. They believed in the vision. I said to myself, If I am going to                  join  a group  of people,  this is  the one.  There  is  a clear  leader, the                 glue to the whole thing. I just felt a real affinity to Jack. I mean who                 wouldn’t?”                       Jack struck Joe as being very different from other entrepreneurs                 he’d  met  or  read  about,  telling  Joe  that  “[t]o  him,  friends  are  as                 important  as  family.  His  definition  of  friends  includes  colleagues.                 When  you  try  to  compare  [Jack]  with,  say,  Steve  Jobs,  they  are                  different people, different to the core.”                       Joe  liked  the  fact  that  Jack  was  open  about  his  own                 shortcomings. “I think me coming into the scene was very novel. I’m                 the  guy  who  knew  finance.  I  was  a  lawyer  before.  I  could  help                 incorporate a company and I could help raise capital. So immediately                 from day one, I think we built a bond.”                       When  I  first  met  Joe,  I  found  him  very  calm  and  reserved,  in                 many  ways  the  polar  opposite  of  Jack’s  exuberance  and                  unpredictability. As I spent more time working with them, I came to                 appreciate  how  Joe’s  professionalism  in,  say,  carefully  drafting  a                 contract  created  the  structure  for  Alibaba  to  harness  Jack’s  energy                 and enthusiasm. Another China Internet founder I spoke to agreed,                 “In the early days, especially, Joe kept Jack in check.”                       Joe is self-effacing about his role at the company. When I asked                 him whether he considered himself Jack’s “consigliere,” he told me he                  prefers to think of himself as Jack’s interpreter: “Jack is very smart.                 But  Jack  sometimes  says  things  that  people  misinterpret,  so  I  am                 there to explain things.”                       Jack is effusive in his praise of Joe, often saluting him for the risk                 he took on joining Alibaba back in 1999. To an audience a few years","ago in Taipei, Jack said, “How many would give up a well-paying job                 like him?” He added, “This is courage. This is action. This is the real                 dream.”                       Joe did take a gamble back in 1999, but it wasn’t a blind bet. Joe                  was able to increase his chances of backing a winner by first getting                 the company ready to raise capital, then taking the lead in finding its                 first investor.                       Joe told his boss at Investor AB, where he would keep his job for                       21                 now,  that he would spend his personal time helping an entrepreneur                 he had met in China.                        Joe  got  to  work  sorting  out  the  paperwork  at  Alibaba.  As  with                 many start-ups, it was a bit of a mess. “When I got to Hangzhou Jack                 didn’t even have a company. He hadn’t incorporated anything yet. It                 was just a website.”                       Joe’s first task was to document Alibaba’s shareholders: “I called                 him up and said, ‘Jack, I’m incorporating the company. Who are the                 shareholders?’  He  faxed  me  a  list  of  the  names.  My  jaw  dropped,                  because every single one of those kids in the apartment was on the                 list, as a shareholder. So from day one, he gave away quite a lot [of                                                                                           22                 equity].” But as Joe looked through the eighteen names  he realized                 that “everybody was a crucial part of the team, whether an engineer                 or  in  customer  service.”  He  laughed  as  he  recalled  the  nickname                 Potato  for  cofounder  Lucy  Peng,  which  she  used  when  answering                  emails sent from Alibaba’s Western customers.                       Next he wanted to get an understanding of Alibaba’s customers.                 He  asked  the  team  how  many  there  were.  When  told  there  were                 twenty-eight thousand, Joe replied, “Wow, that’s a big number!” Yet                 all of the customer information was being stored manually, each one                 on a piece of paper stuffed into a book with all the others.                       Alibaba  wasn’t  generating  any  revenue  and  urgently  need  to                  raise capital. “Of course at that time no capital was available in China.                 It was all American.” Looking at how Sina, Sohu, and NetEase had                                                                             23                 done it, Joe registered an offshore company,  writing out a personal                 check for $20,000 to a law firm, Fenwick \& West, to ready Alibaba’s                 corporate  structure  to  receive  venture  capital  investment.  All  they                 needed now was to find the investors. He set out with Jack for San                  Francisco.    24","On  arrival,  they  checked  into  a  cheap  hotel  off  Union  Square,                 then headed down the next morning to Palo Alto to meet some VCs.                 The  meetings  did  not  go  well.  Joe  recalls  being  peppered  with                 questions: “What are you trying to do? What’s your business model?”                  But  they  didn’t  even  have  a  pitch  book.  “I  had  tried  to  prepare                 something, like a business plan.” But Jack said he didn’t do business                 plans, telling Joe, “I just want to go and meet people, and talk to them                 about it.”                       The trip was a failure, although they did have one promising lead                 from  a  breakfast  meeting  in  Palo  Alto  with  a  Singapore-based                 investor,  Thomas  Ng,  of  Venture  TDF.  The  VCs  weren’t  really                 interested in business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, which seemed                  dull  compared  to  the  excitement  surrounding  Yahoo,  which  Sina,                 Sohu, and NetEase were all able to tap into. There were a couple of                 B2B  examples  that  raised  venture  money—Ariba.com  and                 Commerce One—but they were U.S. based and served a much more                 mature market than Alibaba.                       Other  emerging  China  e-commerce  players  were  beginning  to                 have  some  success  at  fund-raising.  One  was  a  consumer  e-                                                                   25                 commerce  venture  called  8848.net.   Launched  in  April  1999  and                 modeling  its  business  on  Amazon,  8848  sold  books,  software,                 electronics, and other local items, such as IP phone calling cards that                 were popular at the time. It had a well-established backer in forty-six-                 year-old Charles Xue (Xue Biqun). Xue had studied at UC Berkeley at                 the same time as SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son. The chairman of                  8848, Wang Juntao, enjoyed a higher profile in China media circles                 than  Jack.  NetEase  too  was  experimenting  with  consumer  e-                 commerce, holding one of China’s first online auctions in July 1999                 when  the  site  sold  100  PCs  for  a  total  of  $150,000.  Another  new                 business, modeled on eBay, was also emerging: the Shanghai-based                 firm  EachNet,  led  by  a  brilliant  young  Harvard-educated  returnee,                 Shao Yibo, also known as Bo Shao.                        Yet  Jack  was  convinced  that  as  the  largest  supplier  of  labor-                 intensive  commodities  to  the  world,  China  was  ready  for  B2B  e-                 commerce.  But  other  entrepreneurs  had  come  to  the  same                 conclusion. A California-based company had launched a B2B website                 called MeetChina.com and secured the backing of the venture capital","firm IDG. In the coming year or so, MeetChina.com would raise more                 than  $40  million  in  venture  capital,  significantly  more  than  Alibaba.                 MeetChina would also excel at courting the support of governments                 on both sides of the Pacific.                        In  Beijing,  MeetChina.com’s  founders  claimed  a  special                                 26                 relationship  with the powerful Ministry of Information Industry. At its                 April 1999 launch, the company promoted itself as “China’s first major                 government-sponsored                business-to-business            Internet       portal.”                 Cofounder Kenneth Leonard talked up his ties in Washington, D.C.,                 claiming a business relationship with Neil Bush, the younger brother                  of George W. and Jeb Bush, and securing an invitation to the White                 House and publicity for the company’s Asia-wide e-commerce push                 by signing an agreement in Vietnam during Bill and Hillary Clinton’s                 groundbreaking presidential visit to the country the following year.                       MeetChina was good at PR in China, too. One of its cofounders,                 Tom Rosenthal, told the Wall Street Journal, “We’ve got the services                 to make buying from China as easy as buying from a local hardware                  store.” In the following months, MeetChina opened nine offices and                 hired more than 250 staff across China, signing impressive-sounding                 partnerships with a raft of companies including Dun \& Bradstreet and                 Western Union.                       B2B  websites  backed  by  Chinese  government  agencies  were                 stepping up their efforts, too, including chinamarket.com, which Jack                 had  helped  set  up.  Watching  the  traction  Alibaba  was  gaining  with                 companies  in  Zhejiang  Province,  neighboring  Jiangsu  Province                  launched its own website—Made-in-China.com—as well.                       But having just escaped the clutches of government, Jack was                 convinced  that his  customer-first approach  would  prevail  over  other                 websites  that  focused  foremost  on  wining  and  dining  government                 officials.                       None  of  these  sites  would  end  up  being  Alibaba’s  main                 competitor.  Instead  Jack’s  biggest  rival  was  not  even  a  “new                  economy”  company  at  all.  It  was  an  old-school  publisher  of  trade                 magazines.                       Global Sources had been around for more than three decades.                 The  company  was  run  by  its  founder,  Merle  Hinrichs.  A  reclusive                 American whose base of operations was his 160-foot yacht anchored"];
