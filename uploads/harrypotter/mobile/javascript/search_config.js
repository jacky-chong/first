William Penn, More Fruits of Soli tude","Harry Potter and the Deathly                                                      Hallows","CHAPTER ONE                          THE DARK LORD AS CEND ING                        The two men ap peared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the                 nar row, moon lit lane. For a sec ond they stood quite still, wands di-                 rect ed  at  each  oth er's  chests;  then,  rec og niz ing  each  oth er,  they                 stowed their wands be neath their cloaks and start ed walk ing briskly                 in the same di rec tion.     “News?” asked the taller of the two.     “The                 best,” replied Severus Snape. The lane was bor dered on the left by                 wild, low- grow ng bram bles, on the right by a high, neat ly man icured                                    i                 hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their an kles as they                 marched.     “Thought I might be late,” said Yax ley, his blunt fea tures                 slid ing  in  and  out  of  sight  as  the  branch es  of  over hang ing  trees                 broke  the  moon light.  “It  was  a  lit tle  trick ier  than  I  ex pect ed.  But  I                 hope he will be sat is fied. You sound con fi dent that your re cep tion will                  be good?”     Snape nod ded, but did not elab orate. They turned right,                 in to a wide drive way that led off the lane. The high hedge curved in to                 them,  run ning  off  in to  the  dis tance  be yond  the  pair  of  im pos ing                 wrought- iron  gates  bar ring  the  men’s  way.  Nei ther  of  them  broke                 step:  In  si lence  both  raised  their  left  arms  in  a  kind  of  salute  and                 passed straight through, as though the dark met al was smoke.                        The  yew  hedges  muf fled  the  sound  of  the  men’s  foot steps.                 There was a rus tle some where to their right: Yax ley drew his wand                  again  point ing  it  over  his  com pan ion’s  head,  but  the  source  of  the                 noise proved to be noth ing more than a pure- white pea cock, strut ting                 ma jes ti cal ly along the top of the hedge.                       “He al ways did him self well, Lu cius. Pea cocks …” Yax ley thrust                 his wand back un der his cloak with a snort.                        A hand some manor house grew out of the dark ness at the end of                 the  straight  drive,  lights  glint ing  in  the  di amond  paned  down stairs                 win dows. Some where in the dark gar den be yond the hedge a foun-                 tain was play ing. Grav el crack led be neath their feet as Snape and                 Yax ley sped to ward the front door, which swung in ward at their ap-                 proach, though no body had vis ibly opened it.","The  hall way  was  large,  dim ly  lit,  and  sump tu ous ly  dec orat ed,                 with a mag nif icent car pet cov er ing most of the stone floor. The eyes                 of the pale- faced por traits on the wall fol lowed Snape and Yax ley as                  they strode past. The two men halt ed at a heavy wood en door lead-                 ing in to the next room, hes itat ed for the space of a heart beat, then                 Snape turned the bronze han dle.                       The draw ing room was full of silent peo ple, sit ting at a long and                 or nate ta ble. The room’s usu al fur ni ture had been pushed care less ly                 up against the walls. Il lu mi na tion came from a roar ing fire be neath a                 hand some  mar ble  man tel piece  sur mount ed  by  a  gild ed  mir ror.                 Snape and Yax ley lin gered for a mo ment on the thresh old. As their                  eyes grew ac cus tomed to the lack of light, they were drawn up ward                 to the strangest fea ture of the scene: an ap par ent ly un con scious hu-                 man fig ure hang ing up side down over the ta ble, re volv ing slow ly as if                 sus pend ed by an in vis ible rope, and re flect ed in the mir ror and in the                 bare, pol ished sur face of the ta ble be low. None of the peo ple seat ed                  un der neath  this  sin gu lar  sight  were  look ing  at  it  ex cept  for  a  pale                                    t                 young man sit ing al most di rect ly be low it. He seemed un able to pre-                 vent him self from glanc ing up ward ev ery minute or so.                       “Yax ley. Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head of the ta-                 ble. “You are very near ly late.”                       The speak er was seat ed di rect ly in front of the fire place, so that                 it was dif fi cult, at first, for the new ar rivals to make out more than his                  sil hou ette. As they drew near er, how ev er, his face shone through the                 gloom,  hair less,  snake like,  with  slits  for  nos trils  and  gleam ing  red                 eyes whose pupils were ver ti cal. He was so pale that he seemed to                 emit a pearly glow.                       “Severus, here,” said Volde mort, in di cat ing the seat on his im me-                 di ate right. “Yax ley – be side Dolo hov.”                        The two men took their al lot ted places. Most of the eyes around                 the  ta ble  fol lowed  Snape,  and  it  was  to  him  that  Volde mort  spoke                 first.                       “So?”                       “My Lord, the Or der of the Phoenix in tends to move Har ry Pot ter                 from his cur rent place of safe ty on Sat ur day next, at night fall.”                        The  in ter est  around  the  ta ble  sharp ened  pal pa bly:  Some  stiff-                  ened, oth ers fid get ed, all gaz ing at Snape and Volde mort.","“Sat ur day … at night fall,” re peat ed Volde mort. His red eyes fas-                 tened up on Snape’s black ones with such in ten si ty that some of the                 watch ers looked away, ap par ent ly fear ful that they them selves would                  be  scorched  by  the  fe roc ity  of  the  gaze.  Snape,  how ev er,  looked                 calm ly back in to Volde mort’s face and, af ter a mo ment or two, Volde-                 mort’s li pless mouth curved in to some thing like a smile.                       “Good. Very good. And this in for ma tion comes –“                       “ – from the source we dis cussed,” said Snape.                       “My Lord.”                       Yax ley had leaned for ward to look down the long ta ble at Volde-                 mort and Snape. All faces turned to him.                        “My Lord, I have heard dif fer ent ly.”                        Yax ley  wait ed,  but  Volde mort  did  not  speak,  so  he  went  on,                 “Dawlish, the Au ror, let slip that Pot ter will not be moved un til the thir-                 ti eth, the night be fore the boy turns sev en teen.”                       Snape was smil ing.                        “My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this                 must  be  it.  No  doubt  a  Con fun dus  Charm  has  been  placed  up on                 Dawlish. It would not be the first time; he is known to be sus cep ti ble.”                       “I as sure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite cer tain,” said Yax-                 ley.                       “If he has been Con fund ed, nat ural ly he is cer tain,” said Snape.                 “I as sure you, Yax ley, the Au ror Of fice will play no fur ther part in the                  pro tec tion of Har ry Pot ter. The Or der be lieves that we have in fil trat ed                 the Min istry.”                       “The Or der’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a squat man sit-                 ting a short dis tance from Yax ley; he gave a wheezy gig gle that was                 echoed here and there along the ta ble.                       Volde mort did not laugh. His gaze had wan dered up ward to the                  body  re volv ing  slow ly  over head,  and  he  seemed  to  be  lost  in                 thought.                       “My Lord,” Yax ley went on, “Dawlish be lieves an en tire par ty of                 Au rors will be used to trans fer the boy –“                       Volde mort held up a large white hand, and Yax ley sub sid ed at                 once, watch ing re sent ful ly as Volde mort turned back to Snape.                       “Where are they go ing to hide the boy next?”","“At the home of one of the Or der,” said Snape. “The place, ac-                 cord ing to the source, has been giv en ev ery pro tec tion that the Or der                 and Min istry to geth er could pro vide. I think that there is lit tle chance                  of tak ing him once he is there, my Lord, un less, of course, the Min-                 istry has fall en be fore next Sat ur day, which might give us the op por-                 tu ni ty  to  dis cov er  and  un do  enough  of  the  en chant ments  to  break                 through the rest.”                        “Well,  Yax ley?”  Volde mort  called  down  the  ta ble,  the  fire light                 glint ing  strange ly  in  his  red  eyes.  “Will  the  Min istry  have  fall en  by                 next Sat ur day?”                       Once again, all heads turned. Yax ley squared his shoul ders.                        “My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have – with dif fi cul ty,                 and af ter great ef fort – suc ceed ed in plac ing an Im perius Curse up on                 Pius Thick nesse.”                        Many  of  those  sit ting  around  Yax ley  looked  im pressed;  his                 neigh bor, Dolo hov, a man with a long, twist ed face, clapped him on                  the back.                       “It is a start,” said Volde mort. “But Thick nesse is on ly one man.                 Scrim geour  must  be  sur round ed  by  our  peo ple  be fore  I  act.  One                 failed at tempt on the Min is ter’s life will set me back a long way.”                       “Yes – my Lord, that is true – but you know, as Head of the De-                 part ment of Mag ical Law En force ment, Thick nesse has reg ular con-                 tact not on ly with the Min is ter him self, but al so with the Heads of all                  the oth er Min istry de part ments. It will, I think, be easy now that we                 have such a high- rank ing of fi cial un der our con trol, to sub ju gate the                 oth ers,  and  then  they  can  all  work  to geth er  to  bring  Scrim geour                 down.”                       “As long as our friend Thick nesse is not dis cov ered be fore he                 has con vert ed the rest,” said Volde mort. “At any rate, it re mains un-                  like ly that the Min istry will be mine be fore next Sat ur day. If we can not                 touch the boy at his des ti na tion, then it must be done while he trav-                 els.”                        “We  are  at  an  ad van tage  there,  my  Lord,”  said  Yax ley,  who                 seemed de ter mined to re ceive some por tion of ap proval. “We now                 have sev er al peo ple plant ed with in the De part ment of Mag ical Trans-                 port. If Pot ter Ap pa rates or us es the Floo Net work, we shall know im-                  me di ate ly.”","“He will not do ei ther,” said Snape. “The Or der is es chew ing any                 form of trans port that is con trolled or reg ulat ed by the Min istry; they                 mis trust ev ery thing to do with the place.”                         “All  the  bet ter,”  said  Volde mort.  “He  will  have  to  move  in  the                 open. Eas ier to take, by far.”                       Again, Volde mort looked up at the slow ly re volv ing body as he                 went on, “I shall at tend to the boy in per son. There have been too                 many mis takes where Har ry Pot ter is con cerned. Some of them have                 been my own. That Pot ter lives is due more to my er rors than to his                 tri umphs.”                        The  com pa ny  around  the  ta ble  watched  Volde mort  ap pre hen-                  sive ly, each of them, by his or her ex pres sion, afraid that they might                 be blamed for Har ry Pot ter’s con tin ued ex is tence. Volde mort, how ev-                 er, seemed to be speak ing more to him self than to any of them, still                 ad dress ing the un con scious body above him.                       “I have been care less, and so have been thwart ed by luck and                  chance, those wreck ers of all but the best- laid plans. But I know bet-                 ter now. I un der stand those things that I did not un der stand be fore. I                 must be the one to kill Har ry Pot ter, and I shall be.”                       At these words, seem ing ly in re sponse to them, a sud den wail                 sound ed, a ter ri ble, drawn- out cry of mis ery and pain. Many of those                 at the ta ble looked down ward, star tled, for the sound had seemed to                 is sue from be low their feet.                        “Worm tail,” said Volde mort, with no change in his qui et, thought-                 ful  tone,  and  with out  re mov ing  his  eyes  from  the  re volv ing  body                 above, “have I not spo ken to you about keep ing our pris on er qui et?”                       “Yes, m- my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the ta ble,                 who  had  been  sit ting  so  low  in  his  chair  that  it  ap peared,  at  first                 glance, to be un oc cu pied. Now he scram bled from his seat and scur-                  ried from the room, leav ing noth ing be hind him but a cu ri ous gleam                 of sil ver.                        “As  I  was  say ing,”  con tin ued  Volde mort,  look ing  again  at  the                 tense faces of his fol low ers, “I un der stand bet ter now. I shall need,                 for in stance, to bor row a wand from one of you be fore I go to kill Pot-                 ter.”                        The  faces  around  him  dis played  noth ing  but  shock;  he  might                  have an nounced that he want ed to bor row one of their arms.","“No vol un teers?” said Volde mort. “Let’s see … Lu cius, I see no                 rea son for you to have a wand any more.”                       Lu cius Mal foy looked up. His skin ap peared yel low ish and waxy                  in the fire light, and his eyes were sunken and shad owed. When he                 spoke, his voice was hoarse.                       “My Lord?”                       “Your wand, Lu cius. I re quire your wand.”                       “I …”                        Mal foy  glanced  side ways  at  his  wife.  She  was  star ing  straight                 ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long blonde hair hang ing down                 her back, but be neath the ta ble her slim fin gers closed briefly on his                  wrist. At her touch, Mal foy put his hand in to his robes, with drew a                 wand, and passed it along to Volde mort, who held it up in front of his                 red eyes, ex am in ing it close ly.                       “What is it?”                       “Elm, my Lord,” whis pered Mal foy.                        “And the core?”                       “Drag on – drag on heart string.”                        “Good,”  said  Volde mort.  He  drew  out  his  wand  and  com pared                 the  lengths.  Lu cius  Mal foy  made  an  in vol un tary  move ment;  for  a                 frac tion of a sec ond, it seemed he ex pect ed to re ceive Volde mort’s                 wand  in  ex change  for  his  own.  The  ges ture  was  not  missed  by                 Volde mort, whose eyes widened ma li cious ly.                        “Give you my wand, Lu cius? My wand?”                       Some of the throng snig gered.                       “I have giv en you your lib er ty, Lu cius, is that not enough for you?                 But I have no ticed that you and your fam ily seem less than hap py of                 late  …  What  is  it  about  my  pres ence  in  your  home  that  dis places                 you, Lu cius?”                        “Noth ing – noth ing, my Lord!”                       “Such lies Lu cius … “                       The soft voice seemed to hiss on even af ter the cru el mouth had                 stopped mov ing. One or two of the wiz ards bare ly re pressed a shud-                 der as the hiss ing grew loud er; some thing heavy could be heard slid-                 ing across the floor be neath the ta ble.                       The huge snake emerged to climb slow ly up Volde mort’s chair. It                  rose,  seem ing ly  end less ly,  and  came  to  rest  across  Volde mort’s","shoul ders: its neck the thick ness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their                 ver ti cal slits for pupils, un blink ing. Volde mort stroked the crea ture ab-                 sent ly with long thin fin gers, still look ing at Lu cius Mal foy.                        “Why do the Mal foys look so un hap py with their lot? Is my re turn,                 my rise to pow er, not the very thing they pro fessed to de sire for so                 many years?”                       “Of course, my Lord,” said Lu cius Mal foy. His hand shook as he                 wiped sweat from his up per lip. “We did de sire it – we do.”                       To Mal foy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes avert ed                 from Volde mort and the snake. To his right, his son, Dra co, who had                                                                                              l                 been gaz ing up at the in ert body over head, glanced quick y at Volde-                 mort and away again, ter ri fied to make eye con tact.                       “My Lord,” said a dark wom an halfway down the ta ble, her voice                 con strict ed with emo tion, “it is an hon or to have you here, in our fam-                 ily’s house. There can be no high er plea sure.”                       She sat be side her sis ter, as un like her in looks, with her dark                  hair and heav ily lid ded eyes, as she was in bear ing and de meanor;                 where  Nar cis sa  sat  rigid  and  im pas sive,  Bel la trix  leaned  to ward                 Volde mort,  for  mere  words  could  not  demon strate  her  long ing  for                 close ness.                       “No high er plea sure,” re peat ed Volde mort, his head tilt ed a lit tle                 to  one  side  as  he  con sid ered  Bel la trix.  “That  means  a  great  deal,                 Bel la trix, from you.”                        Her face flood ed with col or; her eyes welled with tears of de light.                       “My Lord knows I speak noth ing but the truth!”                        “No  high er  plea sure  …  even  com pared  with  the  hap py  event                 that, I hear, has tak en place in your fam ily this week?”                       She stared at him, her lips part ed, ev ident ly con fused.                       “I don’t know what you mean, my Lord.”                         “I’m  talk ing  about  your  niece,  Bel la trix.  And  yours,  Lu cius  and                 Nar cis sa.  She  has  just  mar ried  the  were wolf,  Re mus  Lupin.  You                 must be so proud.”                       There was an erup tion of jeer ing laugh ter from around the ta ble.                 Many leaned for ward to ex change glee ful looks; a few thumped the                 ta ble  with  their  fists.  The  gi ant  snake,  dis lik ing  the  dis tur bance,                 opened its mouth wide and hissed an gri ly, but the Death Eaters did                  not hear it, so ju bi lant were they at Bel la trix and the Mal foys’ hu mil ia-","tion. Bel la trix’s face, so re cent ly flushed  wit  hap pi ness, had  turned                 an ug ly, blotchy red.                       “She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the out pour ing                  of mirth. “We – Nar cis sa and I – have nev er set eyes on our sis ter                 since she mar ried the Mud blood. This brat has noth ing to do with ei-                 ther of us, nor any beast she mar ries.”                       “What say you, Dra co?” asked Volde mort, and though his voice                 was qui et, it car ried clear ly through the cat calls and jeers. “Will you                 babysit the cubs?”                       The hi lar ity mount ed; Dra co Mal foy looked in ter ror at his fa ther,                 who  was  star ing  down  in to  his  own  lap,  then  caught  his  moth er’s                  eye.  She  shook  her  head  al most  im per cep ti bly,  then  re sumed  her                 own dead pan stare at the op po site wall.                       “Enough,” said Volde mort, stroking the an gry snake. “Enough.”                       And the laugh ter died at once.                       “Many of our old est fam ily trees be come a lit tle dis eased over                  time,”  he  said  as  Bel la trix  gazed  at  him,  breath less  and  im plor ing,                 “You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away                 those parts that threat en the health of the rest.”                        “Yes,  my  Lord,”  whis pered  Bel la trix,  and  her  eyes  swam  with                 tears of grat itude again. “At the first chance!”                       “You shall have it,” said Volde mort. “And in your fam ily, so in the                 world … we shall cut away the canker that in fects us un til on ly those                  of the true blood re main …”                       Volde mort raised Lu cius Mal foy’s wand, point ed it di rect ly at the                 slow ly re volv ing fig ure sus pend ed over the ta ble, and gave it a tiny                 flick.  The  fig ure  came  to  life  with  a  groan  and  be gan  to  strug gle                 against in vis ible bonds.                       “Do you rec og nize our guest, Severus?” asked Volde mort.                        Snape raised his eyes to the up side down face. All of the Death                 Eaters were look ing up at the cap tive now, as though they had been                 giv en per mis sion to show cu rios ity. As she re volved to face the fire-                 light, the wom an said in a cracked and ter ri fied voice, “Severus! Help                 me!”                       “Ah, yes,” said Snape as the pris on er turned slow ly away again.                       “And you, Dra co?” asked Volde mort, stroking the snake’s snout                  with his wand- free hand. Dra co shook his head jerk ily. Now that the","wom an had wo ken, he seemed un able to look at her any more.                       “But you would not have tak en her class es,” said Volde mort. “For                 those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Char ity                  Burbage who, un til re cent ly, taught at Hog warts School of Witchcraft                 and Wiz ardry.”                       There were small nois es of com pre hen sion around the ta ble.

There  was  no  mis tak ing  the  anger                 and  con tempt  in  Volde mort’s  voice.  For  the  third  time,  Char ity                  Burbage re volved to face Snape. Tears were pour ing from her eyes                 in to  her  hair.

Sev er al  of  the  Death  Eaters  leapt  back  in                 their chairs. Dra co fell out of his on to the floor.                        “Din ner,  Nagi ni,”  said  Volde mort  soft ly,  and  the  great  snake                 swayed and slith ered from his shoul ders on to the pol ished wood.","Harry Potter and the Deathly                                                      Hallows","CHAPTER TWO                          IN MEM ORAN DUM                        Har ry was bleed ing.

Then he placed the frag ment on top of that morn ing's Dai ly                  prophet,  which  lay  un read  on  the  bed,  and  at tempt ed  to  stem  the                 sud den up surge of bit ter mem ories, the stabs of re gret and of long-                 ing the dis cov ery of the bro ken mir ror had oc ca sioned, by at tack ing                 the rest of the rub bish in the trunk.                      It took an oth er hour to emp ty it com plete ly, throw away the use-                  less items, and sort the re main der in piles ac cord ing to whether or                 not  he  would  need  them  from  now  on.  His  school  and  Quid ditch                 robes, caul dron, parch ment, quills, and most of his text books were                 piled in a cor ner, to be left be hind. He won dered what his aunt and                 un cle would do with them; burn them in the dead of night, prob ably,                 as if they were ev idence of some dread ful crime. His Mug gle cloth-                 ing,  In vis ibil ity  Cloak,  po tion- mak ing  kit,  cer tain  books,  the  pho to-                  graph al bum Ha grid had once giv en him, a stack of let ters, and his                 wand had been repacked in to an old ruck sack. In a front pock et were                 the Ma raud er's Map and the lock et with the note signed R.A.B. in-                 side it. The lock et was ac cord ed this place of hon or not be cause it                 was valu able – in all usu al sens es it was worth less – but be cause of                 what it had cost to at tain it.                       This left a siz able stack of news pa pers sit ting on his desk be side                 his snowy owl, Hed wig: one for each of the days Har ry had spent at                 Priv et Drive this sum mer.                      He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk.                 Hed wig made no move ment as he be gan to flick through news pa-                 pers, throw ing them in to the rub bish pile one by one. The owl was                 asleep  or  else  fak ing;  she  was  an gry  with  Har ry  about  the  lim it ed                  amount of time she was al lowed out of her cage at the mo ment.","As he neared the bot tom of the pile of news pa pers, Har ry slowed                 down,  search ing  for  one  par tic ular  is sue  that  he  knew  had  ar rived                 short ly af ter he had re turned to Priv et Drive for the sum mer; he re-                  mem bered that there had been a small men tion on the front about                 the  res ig na tion  of  Char ity  Burbage,  the  Mug gle  Stud ies  teach er  at                 Hog warts. At last he found it. Turn ing to page ten, he sank in to his                 desk chair and reread the ar ti cle he had been look ing for.                         AL BUS DUM BLE DORE RE MEM BERED                      By El phias Doge                      I met Al bus Dum ble dore at the age of eleven, on our first day at                  Hog warts. Our mu tu al at trac tion was un doubt ed ly due to the fact that                 we both felt our selves to be out siders. I had con tract ed drag on pox                 short ly  be fore  ar riv ing  at  school,  and  while  I  was  no  longer  con ta-                 gious, my pock- marked vis age and green ish hue did not en cour age                 many to ap proach me. For his part, Al bus had ar rived at Hog warts                  un der the bur den of un want ed no to ri ety. Scarce ly a year pre vi ous ly,                 his fa ther, Per ci val, had been con vict ed of a sav age and well- pub li-                 cized at tack up on three young Mug gles.                      Al bus nev er at tempt ed to de ny that his fa ther (who was to die in                 Azk aban) had com mit ted this crime; on the con trary, when I plucked                 up courage to ask him, he as sured me that he knew his fa ther to be                 guilty.  Be yond  that,  Dum ble dore  re fused  to  speak  of  the  sad  busi-                  ness,  though  many  at tempt ed  to  make  him  do  so.  Some,  in deed,                 were dis posed to praise his fa ther's ac tion and as sumed that Al bus                 too was a Mug gle- hater. They could not have been more mis tak en:                 As any body who knew Al bus would at test, he nev er re vealed the re-                 motest  an ti- Mug gle  ten den cy.  In deed,  his  de ter mined  sup port  for                 Mug gle rights gained him many en emies in sub se quent years.                       In a mat ter of months, how ev er, Al bus's own fame had be gun to                 eclipse that of his fa ther. By the end of his first year he would nev er                 again be known as the son of a Mug gle- hater, but as noth ing more or                 less than the most bril liant stu dent ev er seen at the school. Those of                 us who were priv ileged to be his friends ben efit ed from his ex am ple,                 not to men tion his help and en cour age ment, with which he was al-                 ways gen er ous. He con fessed to me lat er in life that he knew even                  then that his great est plea sure lay in teach ing.","He not on ly won ev ery prize of note that the school of fered, he                 was soon in reg ular cor re spon dence with the most no table mag ical                 names  of  the  day,  in clud ing  Nico las  Flamel,  the  cel ebrat ed  al-                  chemist;  Bathil da  Bagshot,  the  not ed  his to ri an;  and  Adal bert  Waf-                 fling, the mag ical the oreti cian. Sev er al of his pa pers found their way                 in to learned pub li ca tions such as Trans fig ura tion To day, Chal lenges                 in Charm ing, and The Prac ti cal Po tion eer. Dum ble dore's fu ture ca-                 reer  seemed  like ly  to  be  me te oric,  and  the  on ly  ques tion  that  re-                 mained  was  when  he  would  be come  Min is ter  of  Mag ic.  Though  it                          t                 was of en pre dict ed in lat er years that he was on the point of tak ing                 the job, how ev er, he nev er had Min is te ri al am bi tions.                       Three  years  af ter  we  had  start ed  at  Hog warts,  Al bus's  broth er,                 Aber forth, ar rived at school. They were not alike: Aber forth was nev-                 er book ish and, un like Al bus, pre ferred to set tle ar gu ments by du el-                 ing  rather  than  through  rea soned  dis cus sion.  How ev er,  it  is  quite                 wrong to sug gest, as some have, that the broth ers were not friends.                  They rubbed along as com fort ably as two such dif fer ent boys could                 do. In fair ness to Aber forth, it must be ad mit ted that liv ing in Al bus's                 shad ow  can not  have  been  an  al to geth er  com fort able  ex pe ri ence.                 Be ing con tin ual ly out shone was an oc cu pa tion al haz ard of be ing his                 friend  and  can not  have  been  any  more  plea sur able  as  a  broth er.                 When Al bus and I left Hog warts we in tend ed to take the then- tra di-                 tion al tour of the world to geth er, vis it ing and ob serv ing for eign wiz-                  ards, be fore pur su ing our sep arate ca reers. How ev er, tragedy in ter-                 vened.  On  the  very  eve  of  our  trip,  Al bus's  moth er,  Kendra,  died,                 leav ing Al bus the head, and sole bread win ner, of the fam ily. I post-                 poned my de par ture long enough to pay my re spects at Kendra's fu-                 ner al,  then  left  for  what  was  now  to  be  a  soli tary  jour ney.  With  a                 younger  broth er  and  sis ter  to  care  for,  and  lit tle  gold  left  to  them,                  there could no longer be any ques tion of Al bus ac com pa ny ing me.                      That  was  the  pe ri od  of  our  lives  when  we  had  least  con tact.  I                 wrote to Al bus, de scrib ing, per haps in sen si tive ly, the won ders of my                 jour ney, from nar row es capes from chi maeras in Greece to the ex-                 per iments of the Egyp tian al chemists. His let ters told me lit tle of his                 day- to- day life, which I guessed to be frus trat ing ly dull for such a bril-                 liant wiz ard. Im mersed in my own ex pe ri ences, it was with hor ror that","I  heard,  to ward  the  end  of  my  year's  trav els,  that  an oth er  tragedy                 had struck the Dum ble dores: the death of his sis ter, Ar iana.                      Though Ar iana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow,                  com ing so soon af ter the loss of their moth er, had a pro found ef fect                 on both of her broth ers. All those clos est to Al bus – and I count my-                 self one of that lucky num ber – agree that Ar iana's death, and Al-                 bus's feel ing of per son al re spon si bil ity for it (though, of course, he                 was guilt less), left their mark up on him forever more.                      I  re turned  home  to  find  a  young  man  who  had  ex pe ri enced  a                 much  old er  per son's  suf fer ing.  Al bus  was  more  re served  than  be-                 fore, and much less light- heart ed. To add to his mis ery, the loss of                  Ar iana  had  led,  not  to  a  re newed  close ness  be tween  Al bus  and                 Aber forth, but to an es trange ment. (In time this would lift – in lat er                 years they reestab lished, if not a close re la tion ship, then cer tain ly a                 cor dial  one.)  How ev er,  he  rarely  spoke  of  his  par ents  or  of  Ar iana                 from then on, and his friends learned not to men tion them.                       Oth er  quills  will  de scribe  the  tri umphs  of  the  fol low ing  years.                 Dum ble dore's  in nu mer able  con tri bu tions  to  the  store  of  Wiz ard ing                 knowl edge,  in clud ing  his  dis cov ery  of  the  twelve  us es  of  drag on's                 blood, will ben efit gen er ations to come, as will the wis dom he dis-                 played  in  the many  judg ments while  Chief  War lock  of the Wiz eng-                 amot. They say, still, that no Wiz ard ing du el ev er matched that be-                 tween Dum ble dore and Grindel wald in 1945. Those who wit nessed it                  have  writ ten  of  the  ter ror  and  the  awe  they  felt  as  they  watched                 these two ex traor di nary wiz ards to bat tle. Dum ble dore's tri umph, and                 its con se quences for the Wiz ard ing world, are con sid ered a turn ing                 point in mag ical his to ry to match the in tro duc tion of the In ter na tion al                 Statute of Se cre cy or the down fall of He- Who- Must- Not- Be- Named.                      Al bus Dum ble dore was nev er proud or vain; he could find some-                  thing  to  val ue  in  any one,  how ev er  ap par ent ly  in signif icant  or                 wretched, and I be lieve that his ear ly loss es en dowed him with great                 hu man ity and sym pa thy. I shall miss his friend ship more than I can                 say, but my loss is noth ing com pared to the Wiz ard ing world's. That                 he was the most in spir ing and best loved of all Hog warts head mas-                 ters can not be in ques tion. He died as he lived: work ing al ways for                 the greater good and, to his last hour, as will ing to stretch out a hand                  to a small boy with drag on pox as he was on the day I met him.","Har ry fin ished read ing, but con tin ued to gaze at the pic ture ac-                 com pa ny ing the obit uary. Dum ble dore was wear ing his fa mil iar, kind-                 ly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half- moon spec ta cles,                  he gave the im pres sion, even in newsprint, of X- ray ing Har ry, whose                 sad ness min gled with a sense of hu mil ia tion.                       He had thought he knew Dum ble dore quite well, but ev er since                 read ing this obit uary he had been forced to rec og nize that he had                 bare ly known him at all. Nev er once had he imag ined Dum ble dore's                 child hood  or  youth;  it  was  as  though  he  had  sprung  in to  be ing  as                 Har ry had known him, ven er able and sil ver- haired and old. The idea                 of a teenage Dum ble dore was sim ply odd, like try ing to imag ine a                  stupid Hermione or a friend ly Blast- End ed Skrewt.                        He  had  nev er  thought  to  ask  Dum ble dore  about  his  past.  No                 doubt it would have felt strange, im per ti nent even, but af ter all it had                 been  com mon  knowl edge  that  Dum ble dore  had  tak en  part  in  that                 leg endary du el with Grindel wald, and Har ry had not thought to ask                  Dum ble dore what that had been like, nor about any of his oth er fa-                 mous achieve ments. No, they had al ways dis cussed Har ry, Har ry's                 past, Har ry's fu ture, Har ry's plans… and it seemed to Har ry now, de-                 spite the fact that his fu ture was so dan ger ous and so un cer tain, that                 he had missed ir re place able op por tu ni ties when he had failed to ask                 Dum ble dore  more  about  him self,  even  though  the  on ly  per son al                 ques tion he had ev er asked his head mas ter was al so the on ly one                  he sus pect ed that Dum ble dore had not an swered hon est ly:                                  “What do you see when you look in the mir ror?”                                  “I? I see my self hold ing a pair of thick, woolen socks.”                      Af ter sev er al min utes' thought, Har ry tore the obit uary out of the                 Prophet,  fold ed  it  care ful ly,  and  tucked  it  in side  the  first  vol ume  of                 Prac ti cal De fen sive Mag ic and its Use against the Dark Arts. Then                  he threw the rest of the news pa per on to the rub bish pile and turned                 to face the room. It was much ti di er. The on ly things left out of place                 were to day's Dai ly Prophet, still ly ing on the bed, and on top of it, the                 piece of bro ken mir ror.                      Har ry moved across the room, slid the mir ror frag ment off to day's                 Prophet, and un fold ed the news pa per. He had mere ly glanced at the                 head line  when  he  had  tak en  the  rolled- up  pa per  from  the  de liv ery                  owl ear ly that morn ing and thrown it aside, af ter not ing that it said","noth ing about Volde mort. Har ry was sure that the Min istry was lean-                 ing on the Prophet to sup press news about Volde mort. It was on ly                 now, there fore, that he saw what he had missed.                        Across the bot tom half of the front page a small er head line was                 set over a pic ture of Dum ble dore strid ing along, look ing har ried:                         DUM BLE DORE – THE TRUTH AT LAST?

The an swers to these and many more ques tions are ex plored in                 the  ex plo sive  new  bi og ra phy,  The  Life  and  Lies  of  Al bus  Dum ble-                 dore, by Ri ta Skeeter, ex clu sive ly in ter viewed by Berry Braith waite,                 page 13, in side.                       Har ry ripped open the pa per and found page thir teen. The ar ti cle                 was topped with a pic ture show ing an oth er fa mil iar face: a wom an                 wear ing  jew eled  glass es  with  elab orate ly  curled  blonde  hair,  her                  teeth bared in what was clear ly sup posed to be a win ning smile, wig-                 gling her fin gers up at him. Do ing his best to ig nore this nau se at ing                 im age, Har ry read on.                        In per son, Ri ta Skeeter is much warmer and soft er than her fa-                 mous ly  fe ro cious  quill- por traits  might  sug gest.  Greet ing  me  in  the                 hall way of her cozy home, she leads me straight in to the kitchen for                  a  cup  of  tea,  a  slice  of  pound  cake  and,  it  goes  with out  say ing,  a                 steam ing vat of fresh est gos sip.                      “Well,  of  course,  Dum ble dore  is  a  bi og ra pher's  dream,”  says                 Skeeter. “Such a long, full life. I'm sure my book will be the first of                 very, very many.”                      Skeeter was cer tain ly quick off the mark.

I  ask  her  how  she  man aged  this  su per fast                 feat.                      “Oh, when you've been a jour nal ist as long as I have, work ing to                  a  dead line  is  sec ond  na ture.  I  knew  that  the  Wiz ard ing  world  was                 clam or ing for the full sto ry and I want ed to be the first to meet that                 need.”                      I men tion the re cent, wide ly pub li cized re marks of El phias Doge,                 Spe cial Ad vi sor to the Wiz eng amot and long stand ing friend of Al bus                 Dum ble dore's, that “Skeeter's book con tains less fact than a Choco-                 late Frog card.”                      Skeeter throws back her head and laughs.                       “Dar ling  Dodgy!  I  re mem ber  in ter view ing  him  a  few  years  back                 about  mer peo ple  rights,  bless  him.  Com plete ly  gaga,  seemed  to                 think we were sit ting at the bot tom of Lake Win der mere, kept telling                 me to watch out for trout.”                      And  yet  El phias  Doge's  ac cu sa tions  of  in ac cu ra cy  have  been                  echoed  in  many  places.  Does  Skeeter  re al ly  feel  that  four  short                 weeks have been enough to gain a full pic ture of Dum ble dore's long                 and ex traor di nary life?                      “Oh, my dear,” beams Skeeter, rap ping me af fec tion ate ly across                 the knuck les, “you know as well as I do how much in for ma tion can                 be gen er at ed by a fat bag of Galleons, a re fusal to hear the word                 'no,' and a nice sharp Quick- Quotes Quill! Peo ple were queu ing to                  dish the dirt on Dum ble dore any way.

Let's just say that no body hear ing him rage","against You- Know- Who would have dreamed that he dab bled in the                 Dark Arts him self in his youth!

Again, your read ers will have to buy my book                 for the whole sto ry, but there is no ques tion that Dum ble dore took an                 un nat ural in ter est in Pot ter from the word go.

Does  Skeeter  be lieve  that  Pot ter  was                 there when Dum ble dore died?                      “Well, I don't want to say too much – it's all in the book – but eye-                 wit ness es in side Hog warts cas tle saw Pot ter run ning away from the                 scene mo ments af ter Dum ble dore fell, jumped, or was pushed.

That is for the                 Wiz ard ing com mu ni ty to de cide – once they've read my book.”                      On that in trigu ing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt                 that Skeeter has quilled an in stant best seller.

Har ry  reached  the  bot tom  of  the  ar ti cle,  but  con tin ued  to  stare                 blankly  at  the  page.  Re vul sion  and  fury  rose  in  him  like  vom it;  he                 balled up the news pa per and threw it, with all his force, at the wall,                 where it joined the rest of the rub bish heaped around his over flow ing                 bin.","He  be gan  to  stride  blind ly  around  the  room,  open ing  emp ty                 draw ers  and  pick ing  up  books  on ly  to  re place  them  on  the  same                 piles,  bare ly  con scious  of  what  he  was  do ing,  as  ran dom  phras es                  from Ri ta's ar ti cle echoed in his head: An en tire chap ter to the whole                 Pot ter- Dum ble dore  re la tion ship  ...

Har ry sat down hard on the bed. The bro ken bit of mir ror danced                  away from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his fin gers, think-                 ing, think ing of Dum ble dore and the lies with which Ri ta Skeeter was                 de fam ing him ...                       A flash of bright est blue. Har ry froze, his cut fin ger slip ping on                 the  jagged  edge  of  the  mir ror  again.  He  had  imag ined  it,  he  must                  have done. He glanced over his shoul der, but the wall was a sick ly                 peach  col or  of  Aunt  Petu nia's  choos ing:  There  was  noth ing  blue                 there  for  the  mir ror  to  re flect.  He  peered  in to  the  mir ror  frag ment                 again, and saw noth ing but his own bright green eye look ing back at                 him.                      He had imag ined it, there was no oth er ex pla na tion; imag ined it,                 be cause he had been think ing of his dead head mas ter. If any thing                  was  cer tain,  it  was  that  the  bright  blue  eyes  of  Al bus  Dum ble dore                 would nev er pierce him again.                               CHATER THREE                      THE DURS LEYS DE PART ING","The sound of the front door slam ming echoed up the stairs and a                 voice roared, “Oh!

He was still at the nar row frag ment in which, for a split sec-                 ond, he had thought he saw Dum ble dore’s eye. It was not un til his                 un cle bel lowed, “BOY!” that Har ry got slow ly out of bed and head ed                 for the bed room door, paus ing to add the piece of bro ken mir ror to                 the ruck sack filled with things he would be tak ing with him.                      “You took you time!” roared Ver non Durs ley when Har ry ap peared                 at the top of the stairs, “Get down here. I want a word!”                       Har ry strolled  down stairs, his  hands  deep  in  his  pants  pock ets.                 When he searched the liv ing room he found all three Durs leys. They                 were dressed for pack ing; Un cle Ver non in an old ripped- up jack et                 and  Dud ley,  Har ry’s,  large,  blond,  mus cu lar  cousin,  in  his  leather                 jack et.                        “Yes?” asked Har ry.                        “Sit  down!”  said  Un cle  Ver non.  Har ry  raised  his  eye brows.                 “Please!” added Un cle Ver non, winc ing slight ly as though the word                 was sharp in his throat.                      Har ry sat. He though he knew what was com ing. His un cle be gan                 to pace up and down, Aunt Petu nia and Dud ley, fol low ing his move-                 ment with anx ious ex pres sions. Fi nal ly, his large pur ple face crum-                  pled with con cen tra tion. Un cle Ver non stopped in front of Har ry and                 spoke.                                  \"I've changed my mind,” he said.                      “What a sur prise,” said Har ry.                      “Don't you take that tone—” be gan Aunt Petu nia in a shrill voice,                 but Ver non Durs ley waved her down                       “It's all a lot of clap trap,” said Un cle Ver non, glar ing at Har ry with                 pig gy lit tle eyes. ”I've de cid ed I don't be lieve a word of it. We’re stay-                 ing put, we’re not go ing any where.”                      Har ry looked up at his un cle and felt a mix ture of ex as per ation                 and amuse ment. Ver non Durs ley had been chang ing his mind ev ery                 twen ty  four  hours  for  the  past  four  weeks,  pack ing  and  un pack ing                 and  repack ing  the  car  with  ev ery  change  of  heart.  Har ry’s  fa vorite                  mo ment had been the one when Un cle Ver non, un aware that Dud ley","had  added  his  dumb bells  to  his  case  since  the  last  time  it  been                 repacked, had at tempt ed to hoist it back in to the boot and col lapsed                 with a yelp of pain and much swear ing.                       “Ac cord ing to you,” Ver non Durs ley said, now re sum ing his pac-                 ing up and down the liv ing room, “we – Petu nia, Dud ley, and I – are                 in dan ger. From – from –“                      “Some of ‘my lot’ right?” said Har ry                      “Well I don’t be lieve it,” re peat ed Un cle Ver non, com ing to a halt                 in front of Har ry again. “I was awake half the night think ing it all over,                 and I be lieve it's a plot to get the house.”                      “The house?” re peat ed Har ry. “What house?”                       “This house!” shrieked Un cle Ver non, the vein his fore head start-                 ing  to  pulse.  “Our  house!

So why would I want this one? All                  the hap py mem ories?”                                         l                       There was si ence.  Har ry thought he had rather im pressed his                 un cle with this ar gu ment.                      “You claim,” said Un cle Ver non, start ing to pace yet again, “that                 this Lord Thing –”                       “—Volde mort,” said Har ry im pa tient ly, \"and we've been through                  this about a hun dred times al ready.

You're be ing of fered se ri ous pro tec tion, the                 best there is.”                       Un cle Ver non said noth ing but con tin ued to pace up and down.                 Out side  the  sun  hung  low  over  the  priv et  hedges.    The  next  door                 neigh bor's lawn mow er stalled again.                       “I thought there was a Min istry of Mag ic?” asked Ver non Durs ley                 abrupt ly.                      “There is,” said Har ry, sur prised.                      “Well, then, why can't they pro tect us? It seems to me that, as in-                 no cent vic tims, guilty of noth ing more than har bor ing a marked man,                 we ought to qual ify for gov ern ment pro tec tion!”                      Har ry laughed; he could not help him self. It was so very typ ical of                  his un cle to put his hopes in the es tab lish ment, even with in this world                 that he de spised and mis trust ed.                      “You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kings ley said,” Har ry replied.                      “We think the Min istry has been in fil trat ed.”                       Un cle Ver non strode back to the fire place and back breath ing so                 strong ly  that  his  great  black  mus tache  rip pled  his  face  still  pur ple                  with con cen tra tion.                      “All right,” he said. Stop ping in front of Har ry get again. “All right,                 let's  say  for  the  sake  of  ar gu ment  we  ac cept  this  pro tec tion.  I  still                 don't see why we can't have that Kings ley bloke.”                      Har ry man aged not to roll his eyes, but with dif fi cul ty. This ques-                 tion had al so been ad dressed half a dozen times.                      “As I've told you,” he said through grit ted teeth, “Kings ley is pro-                  tect ing the Mug – I mean, your Prime Min is ter.”","“Ex act ly  –  he's  the  best!”  said  Un cle  Ver non,  point ing  at  the                 blank  tele vi sion  screen.  The Durs leys  had  spot ted Kings ley  on  the                 news, walk ing along the Mug gle Prime Min is ter as he vis it ed a hos pi-                  tal.    This,  and  the  fact  that  Kings ley  had  mas tered  the  knack  of                 dress ing  like  a  Mug gle,  not  to  men tion  a  cer tain  re as sur ing  some-                 thing  in  his  slow,  deep  voice,  had  caused  the  Durs leys  to  take  to                 Kings ley in a way that they had cer tain ly not done with any oth er wiz-                 ard, al though it was true that they had nev er seen him with ear ring                 in.                      “Well,  he's  tak en,”  said  Har ry.  ”But  Hes tia  Jones  and  Dedalus                 Dig gle are more than up to the job –\"                        “If we'd even seen CVs…” be gan Un cle Ver non, but Har ry lost                 pa tience. Get ting to his feet, he ad vanced on his un cle, not point ing                 at the TV set him self.                      “These ac ci dents aren't ac ci dents – the crashed and ex plo sions                 and  de rail ments  and  what ev er  else  has  hap pened  since  we  last                  watched the news.

With his par-                 ents' and Har ry's eyes up on him, he slow ly low ered them again and                 asked, “There are… more of them?”                       “More?” laughed Har ry.  “More than the two that at tacked us, you                 mean? Of course there are hun dreds, maybe thou sands by this time,                 see ing as they feed off fear and de spair—”                      “All right, all right,” blus tered Ver non Durs ley. “You've made your                 point –”                      “I hope so,” said Har ry, “be cause once I'm sev en teen, all of them                  – Death Eaters, de men tors, maybe even In feri – which means dead                 bod ies en chant ed by a Dark wiz ard – will be able to find you and will                 cer tain ly at tack you. And if you re mem ber the last time you tried to                 out run wiz ards, I think you'll agree you need help.”                      There  was  a  brief  si lence  in  which  the  dis tant  echo  of  Ha grid                 smash ing down a wood en front door seemed to re ver ber ate through                 the  in ter ven ing  years.  Aunt  Petu nia  was  look ing  at  Un cle  Ver non;                  Dud ley was star ing at Har ry.  Fi nal ly Un cle Ver non blurt ed out, “But","what about my work? What about Dud ley's school? I don't sup pose                 those things mat ter to a bunch of layabout wiz ards –”                      “Don't you un der stand?” shout ed Har ry.  “They will tor ture and kill                  you like they did my par ents!”                      “Dad,” said Dud ley in a loud voice, “Dad – I'm go ing with these                 Or der peo ple.”                      “Dud ley,” said Har ry, “for the first time in your life, you're talk ing                 sense.”                      He knew the bat tle was won. If Dud ley was fright ened enough to                 ac cept the Or der's help, his par ents would ac com pa ny him.  There                 could be no ques tion of be ing sep arat ed from their Dud dykins. Har ry                  glanced at the car riage clock on the man tel piece.                      \"They'll be here in about five min utes, he said, and when one of                 the Durs leys replied, he left the room. The prospect of part ing—prob-                 ably for ev er – from his aunt, un cle, and cousin was one that he was                 able  to  con tem plate  quite  cheer ful ly  but  there  was  nev er the less  a                  cer tain awk ward ness in the air. What did you say to one an oth er at                 the end of six teen years' sol id dis like?                      Back  in  his  bed room,  Har ry  fid dled  aim less ly  with  his  ruck sack                 then poked a cou ple of owl nuts through the bats of Hed wig's cage.                 They fell with dull thuds to the bot tom where she ig nored them.                      “We're leav ing soon, re al ly soon,” Har ry told her. “And then you'll                 be able to fly again.”                       The door bell rang. Har ry hes itat ed, then head ed back out of his                 room and down stairs. It was too much to ex pect Hes tia and Dedalus                 to cope with the Durs leys on their own.                      “Har ry Pot ter!” squeaked an ex cit ed voice, the mo ment Har ry had                 opened the door; a small man in a mauve top hat that was sweep ing                 him a deep bow. “An hon or as ev er!”                       “Thanks,  Dedalus,”  said  Har ry,  be stow ing  a  small  and  em bar-                 rassed smile up on the dark haired Hes tia. “It's re al ly good of you to                 do this… They're through here, my aunt and un cle and cousin…”                      “Good day to you, Har ry Pot ter's rel atives!” said Dedalus hap pi ly                 strid ing in to the liv ing room.  The Durs leys did not look at all hap py to                 be  ad dressed  thus;  Har ry  half  ex pect ed  an oth er  change  of  mind.                 Dud ley shrank neared to his moth er at the sight of the witch and wiz-                  ard.","“I see you are packed and ready. Ex cel lent! The plan, as Har ry                 has  told  you,  is  a  sim ple  one,”  said  Dedalus,  pulling  an  im mense                 pock et  watch  out  of  his  waist coat  and  ex am in ing  it.  “We  shall  be                  leav ing be fore Har ry does.

You know how to drive, I take it?” He asked Un cle Ver non po lite ly.                      “Know how to –? Of course I rud dy well know how to drive!” splut-                 tered Un cle Ver non.                      “Very clever of you, sir, very clever. I per son al ly would be ut ter ly                  bam boo zled by all those but tons and knobs,” said Dedalus. He was                 clear ly un der the im pres sion that he was flat ter ing Ver non Durs ley,                 who  was  vis ibly  los ing  con fi dence  in  the  plan  with  ev ery  word                 Dedalus spoke.                      “Can't even drive,” he mut tered un der his breath, his mus tache                  rip pling  in dig nant ly,  but  for tu nate ly  nei ther  Dedalus  nor  Hes tia                 seemed to hear him.                      “You,  Har ry,”  Dedalus  con tin ued,  “will  wait  here  for  your  guard.                 There has been a lit tle change in the ar range ments –”                      “What d'you mean?“ said Har ry at once. ”I thought Mad- Eye was                 go ing to come and take me by Side Along- Ap pari tion?\"                      “Can't do it,” said Hes tia terse ly, “Mad- Eye will ex plain.”                       The Durs leys, who had lis tened to all of this with looks of ut ter in-                 com pre hen sion  on  their  faces,  jumped  as  a  loud  voice  screeched,                 “Hur ry  up!”  Har ry  looked  all  around  the  room  be fore  re al iz ing  the                 voice had is sued from Dedalus's pock et watch.                      “Quite  right,  were  op er at ing  to  a  very  tight  sched ule,”  said                 Dedalus nod ding at his watch and tuck ing it back in to his waist coat.                  “We are at tempt ing to time your de par ture from the house with your                 fam ily's Dis ap pari tion, Har ry thus the charm breaks the mo ment you                 all  head  for  safe ty.”  He  turned  to  the  Durs leys,  “Well,  are  we  all                 packed and ready to go?”                      None of them an swered him. Un cle Ver non was still star ing ap-                 palled at the bulge in Dedalus's waist coat pock et.                      “Per haps we should wait out side in the hall, Dedalus,” mur mured                  Hes tia. She clear ly felt that it would be tact less for them to re main","the room while Har ry and the Durs leys ex changed lov ing, pos si bly                 tear ful farewells.                      “There's no need,” Har ry mut tered, but Un cle Ver non made any                  fur ther ex pla na tion un nec es sary by say ing loud ly,                      “Well, this is good- bye then boy.”                      He swung his right arm up ward to shake Har ry's hand, but at the                 last mo ment seemed un able to face it, and mere ly closed his fist and                 be gan swing ing it back ward and for ward like a metronome.                      “Ready, Dud dy?” asked Petu nia, fuss ily check ing the clasp of her                 hand bag so as to avoid look ing at Har ry al to geth er.

He had al ready reached the liv ing room door when Dud ley mum-                 bled, “I don't un der stand.”                      “What don't you un der stand, pop kin?” asked Petu nia look ing up                  at her son.                      Dud ley raised a large, ham like hand to point at Har ry.                      \"Why isn't he com ing with us?

Again, Ver non Durs ley marched as far as the front door, but Dud-                 ley did not fol low.                       “Off with some of our lot?”                      Hes tia looked out raged.

As it was, he stared at Dud ley for sev er al sec onds be fore                  ac cept ing that it must have been his cousin who had spo ken; for one                 thing,  Dud ley  had  turned  red.

Hes tia Jones gave her an ap prov-                 ing look that changed to out rage as Aunt Petu nia ran for ward and                 em braced Dud ley rather than Har ry.                      “S- so sweet, Dud ders…” she sobbed in to his mas sive chest. “S-                 such a love ly b- boy… s- say ing thank you…”                      “But he hasn't said thank you at all!” said Hes tia in dig nant ly. “He                 on ly said he didn't think Har ry was a waste of space!”                      “Yea but com ing from Dud ley that's like 'I love you,'” said Har ry,                  torn be tween an noy ance and a de sire to laugh as Aunt Petu nia con-                 tin ued to clutch at Dud ley as if he had just saved Har ry from a burn-                 ing build ing.                      “Are  we  go ing  or  not?”  roared  Un cle  Ver non,  reap pear ing  yet                 again at the liv ing room door. “I thought we were on a tight sched-                  ule!”                      “Yes –yes, we are,” said Dedalus Dig gle, who had been watch ing                 these ex changed with an air of be muse ment and now seemed to pull                 him self to geth er. “We re al ly must be off. Har ry –”                      He tripped for ward and wrung Har ry's hand with both of his own.                      “—good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wiz ard ing                 world rest up on your shoul ders.”                       “Oh,” said Har ry, “right. Thanks.”                      “Far well,  Har ry,”  said  Hes tia  al so  clasp ing  his  hand.  “Our                 thoughts go with you.”                      “I hope ev ery thing's okay,” said Har ry with a glance to ward Aunt                 Petu nia and Dud ley.                      “Oh  I'm  sure  we  shall  end  up  the  best  of  chums,”  said  Dig gle                  slight ly, wav ing his hat as he left the room. Hes tia fol lowed him.                      Dud ley  gen tly  re leased  him self  from  his  moth er's  clutch es  and                 walked  to ward  Har ry  who  had  to  re press  an  urge  to  threat en  him                 with mag ic. Then Dud ley held out his large, pink hand.                      “Blimey, Dud ley,” said Har ry over Aunt Petu nia's re newed sobs,                 “did the de men tors blow a dif fer ent per son al ity in to you?”                      “Dun no,” mut tered Dud ley, “See you, Har ry.”","“Yea …” said Har ry, rak ing Dud ley's hand and shak ing it. “Maybe.                 Take care, Big D.”                      Dud ley near ly smiled. They lum bered from the room. Har ry heard                  his  heavy  foot falls  on  the  grav eled  drive,  and  then  a  car  door                 slammed.                      Aunt  Petu nia  whose  face  had  been  buried  in  her  hand ker chief                 looked around at the sound. She did not seem to have ex pect ed to                 find her self alone with Har ry. Hasti ly stow ing her wet hand ker chief in-                 to her pock et, she said, “Well – good- bye” and marched to wards the                 door with out look ing at him.                      “Good- bye” said Har ry.                       She  stopped  and  looked  back.  For  a  mo ment  Har ry  had  the                 strangest feel ing that she want ed to say some thing to him; She gave                 him  an  odd,  tremu lous  look  and  seemed  to  teeter  on  the  edge  of                 speech,  but  then,  with  a  lit tle  of  her  head,  she  hus tled  out  of  the                 room af ter he hus band and son.","Harry Potter and the Deathly                                                      Hallows","CHAPTER FOUR                          THE SEV EN POT TERS                        Har ry  ran  back  up stairs  to  his  bed room,  ar riv ing  at  the  win dow                 just in time to see the Durs leys' car swing ing out of the drive and off                 up the road. Dedalus’s top hat was vis ible be tween Aunt Petu nia and                 Dud ley  in  the  back seat.  The  car  turned  right  at  the  end  of  Priv et                 Drive,  its win dows  burned  scar let for a mo ment in  the now  set ting                 sun, and then it was gone.                       Har ry picked up Hed wig’s cage, his Fire bolt, and his ruck sack,                  gave his un nat ural ly tidy bed room one last sweep ing look, and then                 made  his  un gain ly  way  back  down stairs  to  the  hall,  where  he  de-                 posit ed  cage,  broom stick, and  bag  near  the foot of the stairs. The                 light was fad ing rapid ly, the hall full of shad ows in the evening light. It                 felt most strange to stand here in the si lence and know that he was                  about to leave the house for the last time. Long ago, when he had                 been left alone while the Durs leys went out to en joy them selves, the                 hours of soli tude had been a rare treat. Paus ing on ly to sneak some-                 thing tasty from the fridge, he had rushed up stairs to play on Dud-                 ley’s com put er, or put on the tele vi sion and flicked through the chan-                                                                                              i                 nels to his heart’s con tent. It gave him an odd, emp ty feel ng re mem-                 ber ing those times; it was like re mem ber ing a younger broth er whom                 he had lost.                        “Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?” he asked Hed-                 wig, who was still sulk ing with her head un der her wing. “We’ll nev er                 be  here  again.  Don’t  you  want  to  re mem ber  all  the  good  times?  I                 mean, look at this door mat. What mem ories … Dud ley sobbed on it                 af ter I saved him from the de men tors … Turns out he was grate ful                  af ter all, can you be lieve it? … And last sum mer, Dum ble dore walked                 through that front door … “                       Har ry lost the thread of his thoughts for a mo ment and Hed wig                 did noth ing to help him re trieve it, but con tin ued to sit with her head                 un der her wing. Har ry turned his back on the front door.                       “And un der here, Hed wig” – Har ry pulled open a door un der the                 stairs – “is where I used to sleep! You nev er knew me then – Blimey,","it’s small, I’d for got ten … “                        Har ry  looked  around  at  the  stacked  shoes  and  um brel las  re-                 mem ber ing how he used to wake ev ery morn ing look ing up at the                  un der side of the stair case, which was more of ten than not adorned                 with a spi der or two. Those had been the days be fore he had known                 any thing about his true iden ti ty; be fore he had found out how his par-                 ents  had  died  or  why  such  strange  things  of ten  hap pened  around                 him.  But  Har ry  could  still  re mem ber  the  dreams  that  had  dogged                 him, even in those days: con fused dreams in volv ing flash es of green                 light and once – Un cle Ver non had near ly crashed the car when Har-                 ry had re count ed it – a fly ing mo tor bike …                        There  was  a  sud den,  deaf en ing  roar  from  some where  near by.                 Har ry straight ened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on                 the low door frame. Paus ing on ly to em ploy a few of Un cle Ver non’s                 choic est swear words, he stag gered back in to the kitchen, clutch ing                 his head and star ing out of the win dow in to the back gar den.                         The  dark ness  seemed  to  be  rip pling,  the  air  it self  quiv er ing.                 Then, one by one, fig ures be gan to pop in to sight as their Dis il lu sion-                 ment  Charms  lift ed.

All around him oth er peo ple were dis mount-                 ing from brooms and, in two cas es, skele tal, black winged hors es.                        Wrench ing  open  the  back  door,  Har ry  hur tled  in to  their  midst.                  There  was  a  gen er al  cry  of  greet ing  as  Hermione  flung  her  arms                 around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Ha grid said, “All righ’,                 Har ry? Ready fer the off?”                       “Def inite ly,” said Har ry, beam ing around at them all. “But I wasn’t                 ex pect ing this many of you!”                       “Change of plan,” growled Mad- Eye, who was hold ing two enor-                  mous  bulging  sacks,  and  whose  mag ical  eye  was  spin ning  from                 dark en ing sky to house to gar den with dizzy ing ra pid ity. “Let’s get un-                 der cov er be fore we talk you through it.”                        Har ry  led  them  all  back  in to  the  kitchen  where,  laugh ing  and                 chat ter ing,  they  set tled  on  chairs,  sat  them selves  up on  Aunt  Petu-                 nia’s gleam ing work sur faces, or leaned up against her spot less ap-                 pli ances; Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in                  a long plait; Fred and George, grin ning iden ti cal ly; Bill, bad ly scarred","and long- haired; Mr. Weasley, kind- faced, bald ing, his spec ta cles a                 lit tle awry; Mad- Eye, bat tle- worn, one- legged, his bright blue mag ical                 eye whizzing in its sock et; Tonks, whose short hair was her fa vorite                  shade  of  bright  pink;  Lupin,  gray er,  more  lined;  Fleur,  slen der  and                 beau ti ful, with her long sil very blonde hair; Kings ley, bald and broad-                 shoul dered;  Ha grid,  with  his  wild  hair  and  beard,  stand ing  hunch-                 backed  to  avoid  hit ting  his  head  on  the  ceil ing;  and  Mundun gus                 Fletch er, small, dirty, and hang dog, with his droopy beady hound’s                 eyes and mat ted hair. Har ry’s heart seemed to ex pand and glow at                 the  sight:  He  felt  in cred ibly  fond  of  all  of  them,  even  Mundun gus,                 whom he had tried to stran gle the last time they had met.                         “Kings ley,  I  thought  you  were  look ing  af ter  the  Mug gle  Prime                 Min is ter?” he called across the room.                        “He  can  get  along  with out  me  for  one  night,”  said  Kings ley,                 “You’re more im por tant.”                        “Har ry,  guess  what?”  said  Tonks  from  her  perch  on  top  of  the                  wash ing ma chine, and she wig gled her left hand at him; a ring glis-                 tened there.                       “You got mar ried?” Har ry yelped, look ing from her to Lupin.                       “I’m sor ry you couldn’t be there, Har ry, it was very qui et.”                       “That’s bril liant, con grat –“                        “All  right,  all  right,  we’ll  have  time  for  a  cozy  catch- up  lat er,”                 roared  Moody  over  the  hub bub,  and  si lence  fell  in  the  kitchen.                  Moody  dropped  his  sacks  at  his  feet  and  turned  to  Har ry.  “As                 Dedalus prob ably told you, we had to aban don Plan A.

There was no need for him to say an oth er word;                  Har ry un der stood the rest of the plan im me di ate ly.                       “No!” he said loud ly, his voice ring ing through the kitchen. “No                 way!”                       “I told them you’d take it like this,” said Hermione with a hint of                 com pla cen cy.                        “If you think I’m go ing to let six peo ple risk their lives -- !”                       “—be cause it’s the first time for all of us,” said Ron.                       “This is dif fer ent, pre tend ing to be me –“                        “Well,  none  of  us  re al ly  fan cy  it,  Har ry,”  said  Fred  earnest ly.                 “Imag ine  if  some thing  went  wrong  and  we  were  stuck  as  specky,                 scrawny gits for ev er.”                       Har ry did not smile.                         “You  can’t  do  it  if  I  don’t  co op er ate,  you  need  me  to  give  you                 some hair.”                        “Well,  that’s  the  plan  scup pered,”  said  George.  “Ob vi ous ly                 there’s no chance at all of us get ting a bit of your hair un less you co-                 op er ate.”                       “Yeah, thir teen of us against one bloke who’s not al lowed to use                  mag ic; we’ve got no chance,” said Fred.                       “Fun ny,” said Har ry, “re al ly amus ing.”                       “If it has to come to force, then it will,” growled Moody, his mag-                 ical eye now quiv er ing a lit tle in its sock et as he glared at Har ry. “Ev-                 ery one here’s over age, Pot ter, and they’re all pre pared to take the                 risk.”                       Mundun gus shrugged and gri maced; the mag ical eye swerved                  side ways to glance at him out of the side of Moody’s head.","“Let’s have no more ar gu ments. Time’s wear ing on. I want a few                 of your hairs, boy, now.”                       “But this is mad, there’s no need –“                        “No need!” snarled Moody. “With You- Know- Who out there and                 half the Min istry on his side? Pot ter, if we’re lucky he’ll have swal-                 lowed the fake bait and he’ll be plan ning to am bush you on the thir ti-                 eth, but he’d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keep ing an                 eye out, it’s what I’d do. They might not be able to get at you or this                 house while your moth er’s charm holds, but it’s about to break and                 they know the rough po si tion of the place. Our on ly chance is to use                 de coys. Even You- Know- Who can’t split him self in to sev en.”                        Har ry caught Hermione’s eye and looked away at once.                       “So, Pot ter – some of your hair, if you please.”                                                                                                  i                       Har ry glanced at Ron, who gri maced at him in a just- do- t sort of                 way.                       “Now!” barked Moody.                        With all of their eyes up on him, Har ry reached up to the top of                 his head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled.                       “Good,” said Moody, limp ing for ward as he pulled the stop per out                 of the flask of po tion. “Straight in here, if you please.”                        Har ry  dropped  the  hair  in to  the  mud like  liq uid.  The  mo ment  it                 made con tact with its sur face, the po tion be gan to froth and smoke,                 then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold.                        “Ooh, you look much tasti er than Crabbe and Goyle, Har ry,” said                 Hermione, be fore catch ing sight of Ron’s raised eye brows, blush ing                 slight ly,  and  say ing,  “Oh,  you  know  what  I  mean  –  Goyle’s  po tion                 tast ed like bo gies.”                       “Right then, fake Pot ters line up over here, please,” said Moody.                       Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt                  Petu nia’s gleam ing sink.                       “We’re one short,” said Lupin.                       “Here,” said Ha grid gruffly, and he lift ed Mundun gus by the scruff                 of the neck and dropped him down be side Fleur, who wrin kled her                 nose point ed ly and moved along to stand be tween Fred and George                 in stead.                       “I’m a sol dier, I’d soon er be a pro tec tor,” said Mundun gus.","“Shut it,” growled Moody. “As I’ve al ready told you, you spine less                 worm, any Death Eaters we run in to will be aim ing to cap ture Pot ter,                 not kill him. Dum ble dore al ways said You- Know- Who would want to                  fin ish Pot ter in per son. It’ll be the pro tec tors who have got the most                 to wor ry about, the Death Eaters’ll want to kill them.”                       Mundun gus did not look par tic ular ly re as sured, but Moody was                 al ready  pulling  half  a  dozen  eggcup- sized  glass es  from  in side  his                 cloak, which he hand ed out, be fore pour ing a lit tle Polyjuice Po tion                 in to each one.                       “Al to geth er, then … “                       Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundun gus drank. All                  of them gasped and gri maced as the po tion hit their throats; At once,                 their  fea tures  be gan  to  bub ble  and  dis tort  like  hot  wax.  Hermione                 and Mundun gus were shoot ing up ward; Ron, Fred, and George were                 shrink ing; their hair was dark en ing, Hermione’s and Fleur’s ap pear-                 ing to shoot back ward in to their skulls.                         Moody,  quite  un con cerned,  was  now  loos en ing  the  ties  of  the                 large  sacks  he  had  brought  with  him.  When  he  straight ened  up                 again, there were six Har ry Pot ters gasp ing and pant ing in front of                 him.                       Fred and George turned to each oth er and said to geth er, “Wow –                 we’re iden ti cal!”                       “I dun no, though, I think I’m still bet ter- look ing,” said Fred, ex am-                  in ing his re flec tion in the ket tle.                       “Bah,” said Fleur, check ing her self in the mi crowave door, “Bill,                 don’t look at me – I’m ‘ideous.”                        “Those  whose  clothes  are  a  bit  roomy,  I’ve  got  small er  here,”                 said Moody, in di cat ing the first sack, “and vice ver sa. Don’t for get the                 glass es,  there’s  six  pairs  in  the  side  pock et.  And  when  you’re                  dressed, there’s lug gage in the oth er sack.”                       The re al Har ry thought that this might just be the most bizarre                 thing  he  had  ev er  seen,  and  he  had  seen  some  ex treme ly  odd                 things.  He  watched  as  his  six  dop pel gangers  rum maged  in  the                 sacks,  pulling  out  sets  of  clothes,  putting  on  glass es,  stuff ing  their                 own things away. He felt like ask ing them to show a lit tle more re-                 spect for pri va cy as they all be gan strip ping off with im puni ty, clear ly","more  at ease  with  dis play ing  his  body  than  they would  have  been                 with their own.                        “I  knew  Gin ny  was  ly ing  about  that  tat too,”  said  Ron,  look ing                  down at his bare chest.                       “Har ry, your eye sight re al ly is aw ful,” said Hermione, as she put                 on glass es.                       Once dressed, the fake Har rys took ruck sacks and owl cages,                 each con tain ing a stuffed snowy owl, from the sec ond sack.                       “Good,” said Moody, as at last sev en dressed, be spec ta cled, and                 lug gage- laden  Har rys  faced  him.  “The  pairs  will  be  as  fol lows:                 Mundun gus will be trav el ing with me, by broom –“                        “Why’m I with you?” grunt ed the Har ry near est the back door.                       “Be cause you’re the one that needs watch ing,” growled Moody,                 and sure enough, his mag ical eye did not wa ver from Mundun gus as                 he con tin ued, “Arthur and Fred –“                       “I’m George,” said the twin at whom Moody was point ing. “Can’t                  you even tell us apart when we’re Har ry?”                       “Sor ry, George –“                       “I’m on ly yank ing your wand, I’m Fred re al ly –“                        “Enough  mess ing  around!”  snarled  Moody.  “The  oth er  one  –                 George or Fred or who ev er you are – you’re with Re mus. Miss Dela-                 cour –“                       “I’m tak ing Fleur on a thes tral,” said Bill. “She’s not that fond of                  brooms.”                       Fleur walked over to stand be side him, giv ing him a sop py, slav-                 ish look that Har ry hoped with all his heart would nev er ap pear on                 his face again.                       “Miss Granger with Kings ley, again by thes tral –“                       Hermione looked re as sured as she an swered Kings ley’s smile;                  Har ry knew that Hermione too lacked con fi dence on a broom stick.                       “Which leaves you and me, Ron!” said Tonks bright ly, knock ing                 over a mug tree as she waved at him.                       Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione.                       “An’ you’re with me, Har ry. That all righ’?” said Ha grid, look ing a                 lit tle anx ious. “We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thes trals can’t take                 me weight, see. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it, though,                  so you’ll be in the side car.”","“That’s great,” said Har ry, not al to geth er truth ful ly.                       “We think the Death Eaters will ex pect you to be on a broom,”                 said Moody, who seemed to guess how Har ry was feel ing. “Snape’s                  had plen ty of time to tell them ev ery thing about you he’s nev er men-                 tioned be fore, so if we do run in to any Death Eaters, we’re bet ting                                                       t                 they’ll choose one of the Pot ers who looks at home on a broom stick.                 All right then,” he went on, ty ing up the sack with the fake Pot ters’                 clothes in it and lead ing the way back to the door, “I make it three                 min utes  un til  we’re  sup posed  to  leave.  No  point  lock ing  the  back                 door,  it  won’t  keep  the  Death  Eaters  out  when  they  come  look ing.                 Come on …”                        Har ry hur ried to gath er his ruck sack, Fire bolt, and Hed wig’s cage                 and fol lowed the group to the dark back gar den.                       On ev ery side broom sticks were leap ing in to hands; Hermione                 had al ready been helped up on to a great black thes tral by Kings ley,                 Fleur on to the oth er by Bill. Ha grid was stand ing ready be side the                  mo tor bike, gog gles on.                       “Is this it? Is this Sir ius’s bike?”                       “The very same,” said Ha grid, beam ing down at Har ry. “An’ the                 last time yeh was on it, Har ry, I could fit yeh in one hand!”                       Har ry could not help but feel a lit tle hu mil iat ed as he got in to the                 side car.  It  placed  him  sev er al  feet  be low  ev ery body  else:  Ron                 smirked at the sight of him sit ting there like a child in a bumper car.                  Har ry  stuffed  his  ruck sack  and  broom stick  down  by  his  feet  and                 rammed Hed wig’s cage be tween his knees. He was ex treme ly un-                 com fort able.                       “Arthur’s done a bit o’ tin kerin’,” said Ha grid, quite obliv ious to                 Har ry’s dis com fort. He set tled him self astride the mo tor cy cle, which                 creaked slight ly and sank inch es in to the ground. “It’s got a few tricks                  up its sleeves now. Tha’ one was my idea.” He point ed a thick fin ger                 at a pur ple but ton near the speedome ter.                      “Please be care ful, Ha grid.” said Mr. Weasley, who was stand ing                 be side them, hold ing his broom stick. “I'm still not sure that was ad-                 vis able and it's cer tain ly on ly to be used in emer gen cies.”                      “All right, then.” said Moody. “Ev ery one ready, please. I want us                 all to leave at ex act ly the same time or the whole point of the di ver-                  sion's lost.”","Ev ery body mo tioned their heads.                      “Hold  tight  now,  Ron,”  said  Tonks,  and  Har ry  saw  Ron  throw  a                 forc ing, guilty look at Lupin be fore plac ing his hands on each side of                  her waist. Ha grid kicked the mo tor bike in to life: It roared like a drag-                 on, and the side car be gan to vi brate.                       “Good luck, ev ery one,” shout ed Moody. “See you all in about an                 hour at the Bur row. On the count of three. One … two .. THREE.”                       There  was  a great  roar  from the mo tor bike,  and  Har ry felt the                 side car  give  a  nasty  lurch.  He  was  ris ing  through  the  air  fast,  his                 eyes  wa ter ing  slight ly,  hair  whipped  back  off  his  face.  Around  him                 brooms  were  soar ing  up ward  too;  the  long  black  tail  of  a  thes tral                  flicked past. His legs, jammed in to the side car by Hed wig’s cage and                 his ruck sack, were al ready sore and start ing to go numb. So great                 was  his  dis com fort  that  he  al most  for got  to  take  a  last  glimpse  of                 num ber four Priv et Drive . By the time he looked over the edge of the                 side car he could no longer tell which one it was.                       And then, out of nowhere, out of noth ing, they were sur round ed.                 At least thir ty hood ed fig ures, sus pend ed in midair, formed a vast cir-                 cle in the mid dle of which the Or der mem bers had risen, obliv ious –                      Screams, a blaze of green light on ev ery side: Ha grid gave a yell                 and  the mo tor bike  rolled  over. Har ry lost any  sense  of where  they                 were.  Street lights  above  him,  yells  around  him,  he  was  cling ing  to                 the side car for dear life. Hed wig's cage, the Fire bolt, and his ruck-                  sack slipped from be neath his knees –                      “No – HELP!”                      The broom stick spun too, but he just man aged to seize the strap                 of his ruck sack and the top of the cage as the mo tor bike swung the                 right  way  up  again.  A  sec ond's  re lief,  and  then  an oth er  burst  of                 green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage.                       “No – NO!”                      The  mo tor bike  zoomed  for ward;  Har ry  glimpsed  hood ed  Death                 Eaters scat ter ing as Ha grid blast ed through their cir cle.                      “Hed wig – Hed wig –”                      But the owl lay mo tion less and pa thet ic as a toy on the floor of                 her cage. He could not take it in, and his ter ror for the oth ers was                 paramount. He glanced over his shoul der and saw a mass of peo ple","mov ing, flares of green light, two pairs of peo ple on brooms soar ing                 off in to the dis tance, but he could not tell who they were –                      “Ha grid, we've got to go back, we've got to go back!” he yelled                  over the thun der ous roar of the en gine, pulling out his wand, ram-                 ming Hed wig's cage in to the floor, re fus ing to be lieve that she was                 dead. “Ha grid, TURN AROUND!”                      “My  job's  ter  get  you  there  safe,  Har ry!”  bel low  Ha grid,  and  he                 opened the throt tle.                      “Stop – STOP!” Har ry shout ed, but as he looked back again two                 jets of green light flew past his left ear: Four Death Eaters had bro-                 ken  away  from  the  cir cle  and  were  pur su ing  them,  aim ing  for  Ha-                  grid's broad back. Ha grid swerved, but the Death Eaters were keep-                 ing up with the bike; more curs es shot af ter them, and Har ry had to                 sink low in to the side car to avoid them. Wrig gling around he cried,                 “Stu pe fy!” and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand, cleav ing a                 gap  be tween  the  four  pur su ing  Death  Eaters  as  they  scat tered  to                  avoid it.                      “Hold  on,  Har ry,  this'll  do  for  'em!”  roared  Ha grid,  and  Har ry                 looked up just in time to see Ha grid slam ming a thick fin ger in to a                 green but ton near the fu el gauge.                      A wall, a sol id black wall, erupt ed out of the ex haust pipe. Cran-                 ing his neck, Har ry saw it ex pand in to be ing in midair. Three of the                 Death  Eaters  swerved  and  avoid ed  it,  but  the  fourth  was  not  so                  lucky; He van ished from view and then dropped like a boul der from                 be hind  it,  his  broom stick  bro ken  in to  pieces.  One  of  his  fel lows                 slowed  up  to  save  him,  but  they  and  the  air borne  wall  were  swal-                 lowed  by  dark ness  as  Ha grid  leaned  low  over  the  han dle bars  and                 sped up.                      More Killing Curs es flew past Har ry's head from the two re main-                  ing  Death  Eaters'  wands;  they  were  aim ing  for  Ha grid.  Har ry  re-                 spond ed  with  fur ther  Stun ning  Spells:  Red  and  green  col lid ed  in                 midair in a show er of mul ti col ored sparks, and Har ry thought wild ly of                 fire works, and the Mug gles be low who would have no idea what was                 hap pen ing –                      “Here we go again, Har ry, hold on!” yelled Ha grid, and he jabbed                 at a sec ond but ton. This time a great net burst from the bike's ex-                  haust,  but  the  Death  Eaters  were  ready  for  it.  Not  on ly  did  they","swerve to avoid it, but the com pan ion who had slowed to save their                 un con scious friend had caught up. He bloomed sud den ly out of the                 dark ness  and  now  three  of  them  were  pur su ing  the  mo tor bike,  all                  shoot ing curs es af ter it.                      “This'll do it, Har ry, hold on tight!” yelled Ha grid, and Har ry saw                 him  slam  his  whole  hand  on to  the  pur ple  but ton  be side  the                 speedome ter.                      With an un mis tak able bel low ing roar, drag on fire burst from the                 ex haust, white- hot and blue, and the mo tor bike shot for ward like a                 bul let with a sound of wrench ing met al. Har ry saw the Death Eaters                 swerve out of sight to avoid the dead ly trail of flame, and at the same                  time  felt  the  side car  sway  omi nous ly:  Its  met al  con nec tions  to  the                 bike had splin tered with the force of ac cel er ation.                      “It's  all  righ',  Har ry!”  bel lowed  Ha grid,  now  thrown  flat  on to  the                 back by the surge of speed; no body was steer ing now, and the side-                 car was start ing to twist vi olent ly in the bike's slip stream.                       “I'm on it, Har ry, don' wor ry!” Ha grid yelled, and from in side his                 jack et pock et he pulled his flow ery pink um brel la.                      “Ha grid! No! Let me!”                      “REPARO!”                      There  was  a  deaf en ing  bang  and  the  side car  broke  away  from                 the bike com plete ly. Har ry sped for ward, pro pelled by the im pe tus of                 the bike's flight, then the side car be gan to lose height –                       In des per ation Har ry point ed his wand at the side car and shout-                 ed, “Wingardi um Leviosa!”                      The  side car  rose  like  a  cork,  un steer able  but  at  least  still  air-                 borne. He had but a split sec ond's re lief, how ev er, as more curs es                 streaked past him: The three Death Eaters were clos ing in.                      “I'm comin',  Har ry!” Ha grid  yelled  from out of the dark ness, but                  Har ry could feel the side car be gin ning to sink again: Crouch ing as                 low as he could, he point ed at the mid dle of the on com ing fig ures                 and yelled, “Im ped imen ta!”                      The jinx hit the mid dle Death Eater in the chest; For a mo ment                 the man was ab surd ly spread- ea gled in midair as though he had hit                 an in vis ible bar ri er: One of his fel lows al most col lid ed with him –                      Then  the  side car  be gan  to  fall  in  earnest,  and  the  re main ing                  Death Eater shot a curse so close to Har ry that he had to duck be low","the rim of the car, knock ing out a tooth on the edge of his seat –                      “I'm comin', Har ry, I'm comin'!”                      A huge hand seized the back of Har ry's robes and hoist ed him                  out of the plum met ing side car; Har ry pulled his ruck sack with him as                 he  dragged  him self  on to  the  mo tor bike's  seat  and  found  him self                 back- to- back with Ha grid. As they soared up ward, away from the two                 re main ing Death Eaters, Har ry spat blood out of his mouth, point ed                 his wand at the falling side car, and yelled, “Con fringo!”                      He knew a dread ful, gut- wrench ing pang for Hed wig as it ex plod-                 ed; the Death Eater near est it was blast ed off his broom and fell from                 sight; his com pan ion fell back and van ished.                       “Har ry, I'm sor ry, I'm sor ry,” moaned Ha grid, “I shouldn'ta tried ter                 re pair it me self – yeh've got no room –”                      “It's not a prob lem, just keep fly ing!” Har ry shout ed back, as two                 more Death Eaters emerged out of the dark ness, draw ing clos er.                      As the curs es came shoot ing across the in ter ven ing space again,                  Ha grid swerved and zigzagged: Har ry knew that Ha grid did not dare                 use  the  drag on- fire  but ton  again,  with  Har ry  seat ed  so  in se cure ly.                 Har ry sent Stun ning Spell af ter Stun ning Spell back at their pur suers,                 bare ly hold ing them off. He shot an oth er block ing jinx at them: The                 clos est Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by                 the red light of his next Stun ning Spell, Har ry saw the strange ly blank                 face of Stan ley Shun pike – Stan –                       “Ex pel liar mus!” Har ry yelled.                      “That's him, it's him, it's the re al one!”                      The hood ed Death Eater's shout reached Har ry even above the                 thun der of the mo tor bike's en gine: Next mo ment, both pur suers had                 fall en back and dis ap peared from view.                      “Har ry,  what's  hap pened?”  bel lowed  Ha grid.  “Where've  they                  gone?”                      “I don't know!”                      But Har ry was afraid: The hood ed Death Eater had shout ed, “It's                 the re al one!”; how had he known? He gazed around at the ap par-                 ent ly emp ty dark ness and felt its men ace. Where were they?                      He clam bered around on the seat to face for ward and seized hold                 of the back of Ha grid's jack et.                       “Ha grid, do the drag on- fire thing again, let's get out of here!”","“Hold on tight, then, Har ry!”                      There was a deaf en ing, screech ing roar again and the white- blue                 fire shot from the ex haust: Har ry felt him self slip ping back wards off                  what lit tle of the seat he had. Ha grid flung back ward up on him, bare-                 ly main tain ing his grip on the han dle bars –                      “I think we've lost 'em Har ry, I think we've done it!” yelled Ha grid.                      But Har ry was not con vinced; Fear lapped at him as he looked                 left and right for pur suers he was sure would come. . . . Why had                 they fall en back? One of them had still had a wand. . . . It's him. . .                 it's the re al one. . . . They had said it right af ter he had tried to Dis-                 arm Stan. . . .                       “We're near ly there, Har ry, we've near ly made it!” shout ed Ha grid.                      Har ry  felt  the  bike  drop  a  lit tle,  though  the  lights  down  on  the                 ground still seemed re mote as stars.                      Then the scar on his fore head burned like fire: as a Death Eater                 ap peared on ei ther side of the bike, two Killing Curs es missed Har ry                  by mil lime ters, cast from be hind –                      And then Har ry saw him. Volde mort was fly ing like smoke on the                 wind, with out broom stick or thes tral to hold him, his snake- like face                 gleam ing  out  of  the  black ness,  his  white  fin gers  rais ing  his  wand                 again –                      Ha grid let out a bel low of fear and steered the mo tor bike in to a                 ver ti cal dive. Cling ing on for dear life, Har ry sent Stun ning Spells fly-                  ing at ran dom in to the whirling night. He saw a body fly past him and                 knew  he  had  hit  one  of  them,  but  then  he  heard  a  bang  and  saw                 sparks from the en gine; the mo tor bike spi raled through the air, com-                 plete ly out of con trol –                      Green jets of light shot past them again. Har ry had no idea which                 way was up, which down: His scar was still burn ing; he ex pect ed to                  die at any sec ond. A hood ed fig ure on a broom stick was feet from                 him, he saw it raise its arm –                      “NO!”                      With a shout of fury Ha grid launched him self off the bike at the                 Death  Eater;  to  his  hor ror,  Har ry  saw  both  Ha grid  and  the  Death                 Eater,  falling  out  of  sight,  their  com bined  weight  too  much  for  the                 broom stick –","i                      Bare ly grip ping the plum met ng bike with his knees, Har ry heard                 Volde mort scream, “Mine!”                      It was over: He could not see or hear where Volde mort was; he                  glimpsed an oth er Death Eater swoop ing out of the way and heard,                 “Ava da –”                      As the pain from Har ry's scar forced his eyes shut, his wand act-                 ed of its own ac cord. He felt it drag his hand around like some great                 mag net, saw a spurt of gold en fire through his half- closed eye lids,                 heard  a  crack  and  a  scream  of  fury.  The  re main ing  Death  Eater                 yelled; Volde mort screamed, “NO!” Some how, Har ry found his nose                 an inch from the drag on- fire but ton. He punched it with his wand- free                  hand and the bike shot more flames in to the air, hurtling straight to-                 ward the ground.                      “Ha grid!” Har ry called, hold ing on to the bike for dear life. “Ha grid                 – Ac cio Ha grid!”                      The  mo tor bike  sped  up,  sucked  to wards  the  earth.  Face  lev el                  with the han dle bars, Har ry could see noth ing but dis tant lights grow-                 ing near er and near er: He was go ing to crash and there was noth ing                 he could do about it. Be hind him came an oth er scream, “Your wand,                 Sel wyn, give me your wand!”                      He  felt  Volde mort  be fore  he  saw  him.  Look ing  side ways,  he                 stared in to the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he                 ev er saw: Volde mort prepar ing to curse him once more –                       And then Volde mort van ished. Har ry looked down and saw Ha-                 grid spread- ea gled on the ground be low him. He pulled hard at the                 han dle bars  to  avoid  hit ting  him,  groped  for  the  brake,  but  with  an                 ear split ting, ground trem bling crash, he smashed in to a mud dy pond.","Harry Potter and the Deathly                                                      Hallows","CHAPTER FIVE                          FALL EN WAR RIOR                        “Ha grid?”                      Har ry  strug gled  to  raise  him self  out  of  the  de bris  of  met al  and                 leather  that  sur round ed  him;  his  hands  sank  in to  inch es  of  mud dy                 wa ter as he tried to stand. He could not un der stand where Volde mort                 had gone and ex pect ed him to swoop out of the dark ness at any mo-                 ment. Some thing hot and wet was trick ling down his chin and from                 his fore head. He crawled out of the pond and stum bled to ward the                  great dark mass on the ground that was Ha grid.                      “Ha grid? Ha grid, talk to me –”                      But the dark mass did not stir.                       “Who's there? Is it Pot ter? Are you Har ry Pot ter?”                       Har ry did not rec og nize the man's voice. Then a wom an shout-                  ed. “They've crashed. Ted! Crashed in the gar den!”                      Har ry's head was swim ming.                      “Ha grid,” he re peat ed stupid ly, and his knees buck led.                      The next thing he knew, he was ly ing on his back on what felt like                 cush ions,  with  a  burn ing  sen sa tion  in  his  ribs  and  right  arm.  His                 miss ing tooth had been re grown. The scar on his fore head was still                 throb bing.                      “Ha grid?”                       He opened his eyes and saw that he was ly ing on a so fa in an                 un fa mil iar, lam plit sit ting room. His ruck sack lay on the floor a short                 dis tance  away,  wet  and  mud dy.

He swung his legs off the so fa; he need ed to see Ha grid with his                 own eyes be fore he would be lieve that he was alive. He had bare ly                 stood  up,  how ev er,  when  a  door  opened  and  Ha grid  squeezed                  through  it,  his  face  cov ered  in  mud  and  blood,  limp ing  a  lit tle  but                 mirac ulous ly alive.                                  “Har ry!”                       Knock ing over two del icate ta bles and an as pidis tra, he cov ered                 the floor be tween them in two strides and pulled Har ry in to a hug that                 near ly cracked his new ly re paired ribs. “Blimey, Har ry, how did yeh                  get out o' that? I thought we were both goners.”                      “Yeah, me too. I can't be lieve –”                      Har ry broke off. He had just no ticed the wom an who had en tered                 the room be hind Ha grid.                       “You!” he shout ed, and he thrust his hand in to his pock et, but it                 was emp ty.                       “Your wand's here, son,” said Ted, tap ping it on Har ry's arm. “It                  fell right be side you, I picked it up…And that's my wife you're shout-","ing at.”                                  “Oh, I'm – I'm sor ry.”                      As she moved for ward in to the room, Mrs. Tonks's re sem blance                  to her sis ter Bel la trix be came much less pro nounced: Her hair was a                 light’s oft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Nev er the less,                 she looked a lit tle haughty af ter Har ry's ex cla ma tion.                      “What hap pened to our daugh ter?” she asked. “Ha grid said you                 were am bushed; where is Nymphado ra?”                        “I  don't  know,”  said  Har ry.  “We  don't  know  what  hap pened  to                 any one else.”                      She and Ted ex changed looks. A mix ture of fear and guilt gripped                  Har ry at the sight of their ex pres sions, if any of the oth ers had died, it                 was his fault, all his fault. He had con sent ed to the plan, giv en them                 his hair . . .                       “The Portkey,” he said, re mem ber ing all of a sud den. “We've got                 to get back to the Bur row and find out – then we'll be able to send                  you word, or – or Tonks will, once she's –”                       “Do ra'll be ok, 'Drome da,” said Ted. “She knows her stuff, she's                 been in plen ty of tight spots with the Au rors. The Portkey's through                 here,” he added to Har ry. “It's sup posed to leave in three min utes, if                 you want to take it.”                       “Yeah, we do,” said Har ry. He seized his ruck sack, swung it on to                 his shoul ders. “I –”                       He  looked  at  Mrs.  Tonks,  want ing  to  apol ogize  for  the  state  of                 fear in which he left her and for which he felt so ter ri bly re spon si ble,                 but no words oc curred to him that he did not seem hol low and in sin-                 cere.                      “I'll tell Tonks – Do ra – to send word, when she . . . Thanks for                 patch ing us up, thanks for ev ery thing, I –”                       He  was  glad  to  leave  the  room  and  fol low  Ted  Tonks  along  a                 short hall way and in to a bed room. Ha grid came af ter them, bend ing                 low to avoid hit ting his head on the door lin tel.                      “There you go, son. That's the Portkey.”                      Mr. Tonks was point ing to a small, sil ver- backed hair brush ly ing                 on the dress ing ta ble.                       “Thanks,” said Har ry, reach ing out to place a fin ger on it, ready                  to leave.","“Wait  a  mo ment,”  said  Ha grid,  look ing  around.  “Har ry,  where's                 Hed wig?”                       “She . . . she got hit,” said Har ry.                        The re al iza tion crashed over him: He felt ashamed of him self as                 the tears stung his eyes. The owl had been his com pan ion, his one                 great link with the mag ical world when ev er he had been forced to re-                 turn to the Durs leys.                      Ha grid reached out a great hand and pat ted him painful ly on the                 shoul der.                      “Nev er mind,” he said gruffly, “Nev er mind. She had a great old                 life –”                       “Ha grid!”  said  Ted  Tonks  warn ing ly,  as  the  hair brush  glowed                 bright blue, and Ha grid on ly just got his fore fin ger to it in time.                      With a jerk be hind the navel as though an in vis ible hook and line                 had dragged him for ward, Har ry was pulled in to noth ing ness, spin-                 ning un con trol lably, his fin ger glued to the Portkey as he and Ha grid                  hur tled away from Mr. Tonks. Sec ond lat er, Har ry's feet slammed on-                 to hard ground and he fell on to his hands and knees in the yard of                 the Bur row. He heard screams. Throw ing aside the no longer glow-                 ing  hair brush,  Har ry  stood  up,  sway ing  slight ly,  and  saw  Mrs.                 Weasley and Gin ny run ning down the steps by the back door as Ha-                 grid, who had al so col lapsed on land ing, clam bered la bo ri ous ly to his                 feet.                       “Har ry? You are the re al Har ry? What hap pened? Where are the                 oth ers?” cried Mrs. Weasley.                       “What d'you mean? Isn't any one else back?” Har ry pant ed.                       The an swer was clear ly etched in Mrs. Weasley's pale face.                       “The Death Eaters were wait ing for us,” Har ry told her, “We were                 sur round ed the mo ment we took off – they knew it was tonight – I                  don't know what hap pened to any one else, four of them chased us, it                 was all we could do to get away, and then Volde mort caught up with                 us –”                                                            i                      He could hear the self- jus ti fy ng note in his voice, the plea for her                 to un der stand why he did not know what had hap pened to her sons,                 but –                      “Thank good ness you're all right,” she said, pulling him in to a hug                  he did not feel he de served.","“Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Mol ly?” asked Ha grid a lit tle                 shak ily, “Fer medic inal pur pos es?”                      She could have sum moned it by mag ic, but as she hur ried back                  to ward the crooked house, Har ry knew that she want ed to hide her                 face. He turned to Gin ny and she an swered his un spo ken plea for in-                 for ma tion at once.                      “Ron  and  Tonks  should  have  been  back  first,  but  they  missed                 their  Portkey,  it  came  back  with out  them,”  she  said,  point ing  at  a                 rusty oil can ly ing on the ground near by. “And that one,” she point ed                 at an an cient sneak er, “should have been Dad and Fred's, they were                 sup posed  to  be  sec ond.  You  and  Ha grid  were  third  and,”  she                  checked her watch, “if they made it, George and Lupin aught to be                 back in about a minute.”                       Mrs. Weasley reap peared car ry ing a bot tle of brandy, which she                 hand ed to Ha grid. He un corked it and drank it straight down in one.                      “Mum!” shout ed Gin ny point ing to a spot sev er al feet away.                       A  blue  light  had  ap peared  in  the  dark ness:  It  grew  larg er  and                 brighter, and Lupin and George ap peared, spin ning and then falling.                 Har ry knew im me di ate ly that there was some thing wrong: Lupin was                 sup port ing George, who was un con scious and whose face was cov-                 ered in blood.                      Har ry  ran  for ward  and  seized  George's  legs.  To geth er,  he  and                 Lupin car ried George in to the house and through the kitchen to the                  liv ing  room,  where  they  laid  him  on  the  so fa.  As  the  lamp light  fell                 across George's head, Gin ny gasped and Har ry's stom ach lurched:                 One of George's ears was miss ing. The side of his head and neck                 were drenched in wet, shock ing ly scar let blood.                      No  soon er  had  Mrs.  Weasley  bent  over  her  son  that  Lupin                 grabbed Har ry by the up per arm and dragged him, none too gen tly,                  back in to the kitchen, where Ha grid was still at tempt ing to ease his                 bulk through the back door.                       “Oi!” said Ha grid in dig nant ly, “Le' go of him! Le' go of Har ry!”                      Lupin ig nored him.                       “What crea ture sat in the cor ner the first time that Har ry Pot ter                 vis it ed my of fice at Hog warts?” he said, giv ing Har ry a small shake.                 “An swer me!”                       “A – a grindy low in a tank, wasn't it?”","Lupin re leased Har ry and fell back against a kitchen cup board.                       “Wha' was tha' about?” roared Ha grid.                      “I'm sor ry, Har ry, but I had to check,” said Lupin terse ly. “We've                  been be trayed. Volde mort knew that you were be ing moved tonight                 and the on ly peo ple who could have told him were di rect ly in volved                 in the plan. You might have been an im pos tor.”                      “So  why  aren'  you  checkin'  me?”  pant ed  Ha grid,  still  strug gling                 with the door.                      “You're  half- gi ant,”  said  Lupin,  look ing  up  at  Ha grid.  “The                 Polyjuice Po tion is de signed for hu man use on ly.”                       “None of the Or der would have told Volde mort we were mov ing                  tonight,” said Har ry. The idea was dread ful to him, he could not be-                 lieve it of any of them. “Volde mort on ly caught up with me to ward the                 end, he didn't know which one I was in the be gin ning. If he'd been in                 on the plan he'd have known from the start I was the one with Ha-                 grid.”                       “Volde mort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply. “What hap-                 pened? How did you es cape?”                      Har ry  ex plained  how  the  Death  Eaters  pur su ing  them  had                 seemed  to  rec og nize  him  as  the  true  Har ry,  how  they  had  aban-                 doned the chase, how they must have sum moned Volde mort, who                 had ap peared just be fore he and Ha grid had reached the sanc tu ary                 of Tonks's par ents.                        “They rec og nized you? But how? What had you done?”                       “I . . .” Har ry tried to re mem ber; the whole jour ney seemed like a                 blur of pan ic and con fu sion. “I saw Stan Shun pike . . . . You know,                 the bloke who was the con duc tor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to                 Dis arm him in stead of – well, he doesn't know what he's do ing, does                 he? He must be Im periused!”                        Lupin looked aghast.                      “Har ry, the time for Dis arm ing is past! These peo ple are try ing to                 cap ture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren't pre pared to kill!”                      “We  were  hun dreds  of  feet  up!

Lupin was re mind ing him of the sneer ing","Huf flepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Har ry for want ing to                 teach Dum ble dore's Army how to Dis arm.                       “Yes, Har ry,” said Lupin with painful re straint, “and a great num-                  ber  of  Death  Eaters  wit nessed  that  hap pen ing!  For give  me,  but  it                 was a very un usu al move then, un der the im mi nent threat of death.

Ig nor ing  his  min gled  oaths  and  apolo gies,  Har ry  ad-                 dressed Lupin again.                       “Will George be okay?”                      All  Lupin's  frus tra tion  with  Har ry  seemed  to  drain  away  at  the                  ques tion.                       “I think so, al though there's no chance of re plac ing his ear, not                 when it's been cursed off –”                      There was a scuf fling from out side. Lupin dived for the back door;                 Har ry leapt over Ha grid's legs and sprint ed in to the yard.                      Two fig ures had ap peared in the yard, and as Har ry ran to ward                  them he re al ized they were Hermione, now re turn ing to her nor mal                 ap pear ance,  and  Kings ley,  both  clutch ing  a  bent  coat  hang er,                 Hermione  flung  her self  in to  Har ry's  arms,  but  Kings ley  showed  no                 plea sure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione's shoul der Har ry                 saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupin's chest.                      “The last words Al bus Dum ble dore spoke to the pair of us!”                      “'Har ry is the best hope we have.

But what made him change tar gets?”                       “Har ry be haved a lit tle too kind ly to Stan Shun pike,” said Lupin.                      “Stan?” re peat ed Hermione. “But I thought he was in Azk aban?”                      Kings ley let out a mirth less laugh.                        “Hermione,  there's  ob vi ous ly  been  a  mass  break out  which  the                 Min istry has hushed up.

Where's George?”                                  “He lost an ear,” said Lupin.                                  “lost an -- ?” re peat ed Hermione in a high voice.                                  “Snape's work,” said Lupin.                                  “Snape?” shout ed Har ry. “You didn't say –”                        “He lost his hood dur ing the chase.

There was no sign of move ment; the stars stared back, un blink-                 ing,  in dif fer ent,  un ob scured  by  fly ing  friends.  Where  was  Ron?","Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks,                 Mad- Eye, and Mundun gus?                       “Har ry, give us a hand!” called Ha grid hoarse ly from the door, in                  which he was stuck again. Glad of some thing to do, Har ry pulled him                 free, the head ed through the emp ty kitchen and back in to the sit ting                 room, where Mrs. Weasley and Gin ny were still tend ing to George.                 Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleed ing now, and by the lamp light                 Har ry saw a clean gap ing hole where George's ear had been.                                  “How is he?”                        Mrs.  Weasley  looked  around  and  said,  “I  can't  make  it  grow                 back,  not  when  it's  been  re moved  by  Dark  Mag ic.  But  it  could've                  been so much worse . . . . He's alive.”                                  “Yeah,” said Har ry. “Thank God.”                                  “Did I hear some one else in the yard?” Gin ny asked.                                  “Hermione and Kings ley,” said Har ry.                      “Thank good ness,” Gin ny whis pered. They looked at each oth er;                  Har ry want ed to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much                 that Mrs. Weasley was there, but be fore he could act on the im pulse,                 there was a great crash from the kitchen.                                  “I'll prove who I am, Kings ley, af ter I've seen my son, now                 back off if you know what's good for you!”                       Har ry had nev er heard Mr. Weasley shout like that be fore. He                 burst  in to  the  liv ing  room,  his  bald  patch  gleam ing  with  sweat,  his                  spec ta cles askew, Fred right be hind him, both pale but un in jured.                                  “Arthur!” sobbed Mrs. Weasley. “Oh thank good ness!”                                  “How is he?”                      Mr. Weasley  dropped  to his  knees  be side  George.  For the first                 time since Har ry had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words.                 He gaped over the back of the so fa at his twin's wound as if he could                  not be lieve what he was see ing.                      Per haps  roused  by  the  sound  of  Fred  and  their  fa ther's  ar rival,                 George stirred.                      “How do you feel, Georgie?” whis pered Mrs. Weasley.                                  George's fin gers groped for the side of his head.                                  “Saint like,” he mur mured.                                  “What's wrong with him?” croaked Fred, look ing ter ri fied.                  “Is his mind af fect ed?”","“Saint ike,” re peat ed George, open ing his eyes and look-                                         l                 ing up at his broth er. “You see. . .

Col or flood ed                  Fred's pale face.                                  “Pa thet ic,” he told George. “Pa thet ic! With the whole wide                 world of ear- re lat ed hu mor be fore you, you go for ho ley?”                                  “Ah well,” said George, grin ning at his tear- soaked moth-                 er. “You'll be able to tell us apart now, any way, Mum.”                                  He looked around.                                  “Hi, Har ry – you are Har ry, right?”                                  “Yeah, I am,” said Har ry, mov ing clos er to the so fa.                                   “Well, at least we got you back okay,” said George. “Why                 aren't Ron and Bill hud dled round my sickbed?”                      “They're not back yet, George,” said Mrs. Weasley. George's grin                 fad ed.  Har ry  glanced  at  Gin ny  and  mo tioned  to  her  to  ac com pa ny                 him back out side. As they walked through the kitchen she said in a                  low voice.                        “Ron and Tonks should be back by now. They didn't have a long                 jour ney; Aun tie Muriel's not that far from here.”                      Har ry said noth ing. He had been try ing to keep fear at bay ev er                 since  reach ing  the  Bur row,  but  now  it  en veloped  him,  seem ing  to                 crawl  over  his  skin,  throb bing  in  his  chest,  clog ging  his  throat.  As                 they walked down the back steps in to the dark yard, Gin ny took his                  hand.                      Kings ley was strid ing back ward and for ward, glanc ing up at the                 sky ev ery time he turned. Har ry was re mind ed of Un cle Ver non pac-                 ing the liv ing room a mil lion years ago. Ha grid, Hermione, and Lupin                 stood shoul der to shoul der, gaz ing up ward in si lence. None of them                 looked around when Har ry and Gin ny joined their silent vig il.                       The min utes stretched in to what might as well have been years.                 The slight est breath of wind made them all jump and turn to ward the                 whis per ing bush or tree in the hope that one of the miss ing Or der                 mem bers might leap un scathed from its leaves –                       And then a broom ma te ri al ized di rect ly above them and streaked                 to ward the ground –                                  “It's them!” screamed Hermione.","Tonks land ed in a long skid that sent earth and peb bles ev ery-                 where.                                  “Re mus!” Tonks cried as she stag gered off the broom in to                  Lupin's  arms.  His  face  was  set  and  white:  He  seemed  un able  to                 speak, Ron tripped dazed ly to ward Har ry and Hermione.                                  “You're okay,” he mum bled, be fore Hermione flew at him                 and hugged him tight ly.                                  “I thought – I thought –”                                  “'M all right,” said Ron, pat ting her on the back. “'M fine.”                                  “Ron was great,” said Tonks warm ly, re lin quish ing her                 hold on Lupin. “Won der ful.

He nod ded, but seemed                  un able to say any thing else.                       “So what hap pened to you lot?” Tonks asked, turn ing to Har ry,                 Hermione, and Kings ley.                      They re count ed the sto ries of their own jour neys, but all the time                 the  con tin ued  ab sence  of  Bill,  Fleur,  Mad- Eye,  and  Mundun gus                 seemed to lie up on them like a frost, its icy bite hard er and hard er to                 ig nore.","“I'm go ing to have to get back to Down ing Street, I should have                 been there an hour ago,” said Kings ley fi nal ly, af ter a last sweep ing                 gaze at the sky. “Let me know when they're back,.”                        Lupin nod ded. With a wave to the oth ers, Kings ley walked away                 in to  the  dark ness  to ward  the  gate.  Har ry  thought  he  heard  the                 faintest  pop  as  Kings ley  Dis ap pa rat ed  just  be yond  the  Bur row's                 bound aries.                      Mr. And Mrs. Weasley came rac ing down the back steps, Gin ny                 be hind them. Both par ents hugged Ron be fore turn ing to Lupin and                 Tonks.                                  “Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley, “for our sons.”                                   “Don't be sil ly, Mol ly,” said Tonks at once.                                  “How's George?” asked Lupin.                                  “What's wrong with him?” piped up Ron.                                  “He's lost –”                      But the end of Mrs. Weasley's sen tence was drowned in a gen er-                  al out cry. A thes tral had just soared in to sight and land ed a few feet                 from them. Bill and Fleur slid from its back, windswept but un hurt.                                  “Bill! Thank God, thank God –”                       Mrs. Weasley ran for ward, but the hug Bill be stowed up on her                 was per func to ry. Look ing di rect ly at his fa ther, he said, “Mad- Eye's                 dead.”                      No body  spoke,  no body  moved.  Har ry  felt  as  though  some thing                  in side him was falling, falling through the earth, leav ing him for ev er.                       “We saw it,” said Bill; Fleur nod ded, tear tracks glit ter ing on her                 cheeks in the light from the kitchen win dow. “It hap pened just af ter                 we broke out of the cir cle: Mad- Eye and Dung were close by us, they                 were head ing north too. Volde mort – he can fly – went straight for                 them. Dung pan icked, I heard him cry out, Mad- Eye tried to stop him,                  but he Dis ap pa rat ed.

They all stood look ing at each oth er. Har ry could not quite com-                 pre hend it. Mad- Eye dead; it could not be . . . . Mad- Eye, so tough,                  so brave, the con sum mate sur vivor . . .","At  last  it  seemed  to  dawn  on  ev ery one,  though  no body  said  it,                 that there was no point of wait ing in the yard any more, and in si lence                 they fol lowed Mr. And Mrs. Weasley back in to the Bur row, and in to                  the liv ing room, where Fred and George were laugh ing to geth er.                                  “What's wrong?” said Fred, scan ning their faces as they                 en tered, “What's hap pened? Who's --?”                                  “Mad- Eye,” said Mr. Weasley, “Dead.”                      The twins' grins turned to gri maces of shock. No body seemed to                 know what to do. Tonks was cry ing silent ly in to a hand ker chief: She                 had  been  close  to  Mad- Eye,  Har ry  knew,  his  fa vorite  and  his  pro-                 tégée at the Min istry of Mag ic. Ha grid, who had sat down on the floor                  in  the  cor ner  where  he  had  most  space,  was  dab bing  at  his  eyes                 with his table cloth- sized hand ker chief.                                  Bill walked over to the side board and pulled out a bot tle of                 fire- whisky and some glass es.                                  “Here,” he said, and with a wave of his wand, eh sent                  twelve full glass es soar ing through the room to each of them, hold ing                 the thir teenth aloft. “Mad- Eye.”                                  “Mad- Eye,” they all said, and drank.                                  “Mad- Eye,” echoed Ha grid, a lit tle late, with a hic cup. The                 firewhisky seared Har ry's throat. It seemed to burn feel ing back in to                 him, dis pelling the numb ness and sense of un re al ity fir ing him with                 some thing that was like courage.                                               “So  Mundun gus  dis ap peared?”  said  Lupin,  who  had                 drained his own glass in one.                                  The at mo sphere changed at once. Ev ery body looked                 tense, watch ing Lupin, both want ing him to go on, it seemed to Har-                 ry, and slight ly afraid of what they might hear.                                  “I know what you're think ing,” said Bill, “and I won dered                  that too, on the way back here, be cause they seemed to be ex pect-                 ing  us,  didn't  they?

He didn't want to come in the first place, but Mad- Eye","made him, and You- Know- Who went straight for them. It was enough                 to make any one pan ic.”                                  “You- Know- Who act ed ex act ly as Mad- Eye ex pect ed him                  to,”  sniffed  Tonks.  “Mad- Eye  said  he'd  ex pect  the  re al  Har ry  to  be                 with the tough est, most skilled Au rors. He chased Mad- Eye first, and                 when Mundun gus gave them away he switched to Kings ley. . . . ”                                  “Yes, and zat eez all very good,” snapped Fleur, “but still                 eet  does  not  ex plain  'ow  zey  know  we  were  mov ing  'Ar ry  tonight,                 does eet?

No-                 body did. The on ly sound to break the si lence was that of Ha grid hic-                 cup ping from be hind his hand ker chief. Har ry glanced at Ha grid, who                 had just risked his own life to save Har ry's – Ha grid, whom he loved,                  whom he trust ed, who had once been tricked in to giv ing Volde mort                 cru cial in for ma tion in ex change for a drag on's egg. . . .                                  “No,” Har ry said aloud, and they all looked at him, sur-                 prised: The firewhisky seemed to have am pli fied his voice. “I mean .                 . . if some body made a mis take,” Har ry went on, “and let some thing                 slip, I know they didn't mean to do it. It's not their fault,” he re peat ed,                 again a lit tle loud er than he would usu al ly have spo ken. “We've got                  to trust each oth er. I trust all of you, I don't think any one in this room                 would ev er sell me to Volde mort.”                                  More si lence fol lowed his words. They were all look ing at                 him; Har ry felt a lit tle hot again, and drank some more firewhisky for                 some thing to do. As he drank, he thought of Mad- Eye. Mad- Eye had                 al ways been scathing about Dum ble dore's will ing ness to trust peo-                  ple.                                  “Well said, Har ry,” said Fred un ex pect ed ly.                                  “Year, 'ear, 'ear,” said George, with half a glance at Fred,                 the cor ner of whose mouth twitched.                                  Lupin was wear ing an odd ex pres sion as he looked at                 Har ry. It was close to pity ing.                                  “You think I'm a fool?” de mand ed Har ry.","“No, I think you're like James,” said Lupin, “who would                 have re gard ed it as the height of dis hon or to mis trust his friends.”                                  Har ry knew what Lupin was get ting at: that his fa ther had                  been be trayed by his friend Pe ter Pet ti grew. He felt ir ra tional ly an gry.                 He want ed to ar gue, but Lupin had turned away from him, set down                 his glass up on a side ta ble, and ad dressed Bill, “There's work to do. I                 can ask Kings ley whether –”                                  “No,” said Bill at once, “I'll do it, I'll come.”                                  “Where are you go ing?” said Tonks and Fleur to geth er.                                  “Mad- Eye's body,” said Lupin. “We need to re cov er it.”                                  “Can't it -- ?” be gan Mrs. Weasley with an ap peal ng look                                                                                                  i                 at Bill.                                  “Wait?”  said  Bill,  “Not un less  you'd  rather  the Death                 Eaters took it?”                                  No body spoke. Lupin and Bill said good bye and left.                                  The rest of them now dropped in to chairs, all ex cept for                  Har ry, who re mained stand ing. The sud den ness and com plete ness                 of death was with them like a pres ence.                                  “I've got to go too,” said Har ry.                                  Ten pairs of star tled eyes looked at him.                                  “Don't be sil ly, Har ry,” said Mrs. Weasley, “What are you                 talk ing about?”                                  “I can't stay here.”                                   He rubbed his fore head; it was prick ling again, he had not                 hurt like this for more than a year.                                  “You're all in dan ger while I'm here. I don't want –”                                  “But don't be so sil ly!” said Mrs. Weasley. “The whole                 point  of tonight  was  to get you  here  safe ly, and  thank  good ness  it                 worked. And Fleur's agreed to get mar ried here rather than in France                  , we've ar ranged ev ery thing so that we can all stay to geth er and look                 af ter you –”                                  She did not un der stand; she was mak ing him feel worse,                 not bet ter.                                  “If Volde mort finds out I'm here –”                                  “But why should he?” asked Mrs. Weasley.                                  “There are a dozen places you might be now, Har ry,” said                  Mr. Weasley. “He's got no way of know ing which safe house you're","in.”                                  “It's not me I'm wor ried for!” said Har ry.                                  “We know that,” said Mr. Weasley qui et ly, but it would                  make our ef forts tonight seem rather point less if you left.\"                                  “Yer not goin' any where,” growled Ha grid. “Blimey, Har ry,                 af ter all we wen' through ter get you here?”                                  “Yeah, what about my bleed ing ear?” said George, hoist-                 ing him self up on his cush ions.                                  “I know that –”                                  “Mad- Eye wouldn't want –”                                  “I KNOW!” Har ry bel lowed.                       He  felt be lea guered  and  black mailed:  Did  they think  he  did  not                 know what they had done for him, didn't they un der stand that it was                 for pre cise ly that rea son that he want ed to go now, be fore they had                 to suf fer any more on his be half? There was a long and awk ward si-                 lence in which his scar con tin ued to prick le and throb, and which was                  bro ken at last by Mrs. Weasley.                                  “Where's Hed wig, Har ry?” she said coax ing ly. “We can                 put her up with Pid wid geon and give her some thing to eat.”                                  His in sides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the                 truth. He drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid an swer ing.                                  “Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Har ry,” said Ha grid.                 “Es caped  him,  fought  him  off  when  he  was  right  on  top  of                  yeh!”                                  “It wasn't me,” said Har ry flat ly. “It was my wand. My wand                 act ed of its own ac cord.”                                  Af ter a few mo ments, Hermione said gen tly, “But that's                 im pos si ble, Har ry. You mean that you did mag ic with out mean ing to;                 you re act ed in stinc tive ly.”                                   “No,” said Har ry. “The bike was falling, I couldn't have told                 you where Volde mort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found                 him and shot a spell at him, and it wasn't even a spell I rec og nized.                 I've nev er made gold flames ap pear be fore.”                                  “Of ten,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you're in a pres sured sit-                 ua tion you can pro duce mag ic you nev er dreamed of. Small chil dren                 of ten find, be fore they're trained –”","“It wasn't like that,” said Har ry through grit ted teeth. His                                    i                 scar was burn ng. He felt an gry and frus trat ed; he hat ed the idea that                 they were all imag in ing him to have pow er to match Volde mort's.                                   No one said any thing. He knew that they did not be lieve                 him. Now that he came to think of it, he had nev er heard of a wand                 per form ing mag ic on its own be fore.                                  His scar seared with pain, it was all he could do not to                 moan aloud. Mut ter ing about fresh air, he set down his glass and left                 the room.                                  As he crossed the yard, the great skele tal thes tral looked                 up  – rus tled  its enor mous  bat like  wings,  then  re sumed  its graz ing.                  Har ry  stopped  at  the  gate  in to  the  gar den,  star ing  out  at  its  over-                 grown plants, rub bing his pound ing fore head and think ing of Dum-                 ble dore.                                  Dum ble dore would have be lieved him, he knew it. Dum-                 ble dore would have known how and why Har ry's wand had act ed in-                  de pen dent ly, be cause Dum ble dore al ways had the an swers; he had                 known about wands, had ex plained to Har ry the strange con nec tion                 that ex ist ed be tween his wand and Volde mort's . . . . But Dum ble-                 dore, like Mad- Eye, like Sir ius, like his par ents, like his poor owl, all                 were  gone  where  Har ry  could  nev er  talk  to  them  again.  He  felt  a                 burn ing in his throat that had noth ing to do with firewhisky. . . .                                  And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As                  he clutched his fore head and closed his eyes, a voice screamed in-                 side his head.                                  “You told me the prob lem would be solved by us ing an oth-                 er's wand!”                                  And in to his mind burst the vi sion of an ema ci at ed old                 man ly ing in rags up on a stone floor, scream ing, a hor ri ble drawn- out                  scream, a scream of un en durable agony. . . .                                  “No! No! I beg you, I beg you. . . .”                                  “You lied to Lord Volde mort, Ol li van der!”                                  “I did not. . . . I swear I did not. . . .”                                  “You sought to help Pot ter, to help him es cape me!”                                  “I swear I did not. . . . I be lieved a dif fer ent wand would                 work. . . .”","“Ex plain, then, what hap pened. Lu cius's wand is de-                 stroyed!”                                  “I can not un der stand. . . .

It was sev er al mo ments be fore he re al ized                 that Ron and Hermione were at his side.                                  “Har ry, come back in the house,” Hermione whis pered,                 “You aren't still think ing of leav ing?”                                   “Yeah, you've got to stay, mate,” said Ron, thump ing Har-                 ry on the back.                                  “Are you all right?” Hermione asked, close enough now to                 look in to Har ry's face. “You look aw ful!”                                  “Well,” said Har ry shak ily, “I prob ably look bet ter than Ol li-                 van der. . . .”                                  When he had fin ished telling them what he had seen, Ron                  looked ap palled, but Hermione down right ter ri fied.                                  “But it was sup posed to have stopped!

Dad  and  Lupin’ve                 both asked as well, but when we said Dum ble dore told you not to tell","any one ex cept us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She’s de ter-                 mined.”                      Ron’s  pre dic tion  came  true  with in  hours.  Short ly  be fore  lunch,                  Mrs. Weasley de tached Har ry from the oth ers by ask ing him to help                 iden ti fy a lone man’s sock that she thought might have come out of                 his ruck sack. Once she had him cor nered in the tiny scullery off the                 kitchen, she start ed.                      “Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are drop-                 ping out of Hog warts,” she be gan in a light, ca su al tone.                      “Oh,” said Har ry. “Well, yeah. We are.”                      The  man gle  turned  of  its  own  ac cord  in  a  cor ner,  wring ing  out                  what looked like one of Mr. Weasley’s vests.                      “May I ask why you are aban don ing your ed uca tion?” said Mrs.                 Weasley.                      “Well, Dum ble dore left me . . . stuff to do,” mum bled Har ry. “Ron                 and Hermione know about it, and they want to come too.”                       “What sort of ‘stuff’?”                      “I’m sor ry, I can’t –“                      “Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I’m                 sure Mr. And Mrs. Granger would agree!” said Mrs. Weasley. Har ry                 had been afraid of the “con cerned par ent” at tack. He forced him self                 to look di rect ly in to her eyes, notic ing as he did so that they were                 pre cise ly the same shade of brown as Gin ny’s. This did not help.                       “Dum ble dore didn’t want any one else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I’m                 sor ry. Ron and Hermione don’t have to come, it’s their choice –“                      “I don’t see that you have to go ei ther!” she snapped, drop ping all                 pre tense now. “You’re bare ly of age, any of you! It’s ut ter non sense,                 if  Dum ble dore  need ed  work  do ing,  he  had  the  whole  Or der  at  his                 com mand!  Har ry,  you  must  have  mis un der stood  him.  Prob ably  he                  was telling you some thing he want ed done, and you took it to mean                 that he want ed you–“                      “I didn’t mis un der stand,” said Har ry flat ly. “It’s got to be me.”                      He hand ed her back the sin gle sock he was sup posed to be iden-                 ti fy ing, which was pat terned with gold en bul rush es.                      “And that’s not mine. I don’t sup port Pud dle mere Unit ed.”                      “Oh, of course not,” said Mrs. Weasley with a sud den and rather                  un nerv ing  re turn  to  her  ca su al  tone.  “I  should  have  re al ized.  Well,","Har ry, while we’ve still got you here, you won’t mind help ing with the                 prepa ra tions  for  Bill  and  Fleur’s  wed ding,  will  you?  There’s  still  so                 much to do.”                       “No – I – of course not,” said Har ry, dis con cert ed by this sud den                 change of sub ject.                      “Sweet  of  you,”  she  replied,  and  she  smiled  as  she  left  the                 scullery.                      From  that  mo ment  on,  Mrs.  Weasley  kept  Har ry,  Ron  and                 Hermione so busy with prepa ra tions for the wed ding that they hard ly                 had any time to think. The kind est ex pla na tion of this be hav ior would                 have  been  that  Mrs.  Weasley  want ed  to  dis tract  them  all  from                  thoughts of Mad- Eye and the ter rors of their re cent jour ney. Af ter two                 days of non stop cut lery clean ing, of col or- match ing fa vors, rib bons,                 and  flow ers,  of  de- gnom ing  the  gar den  and  help ing  Mrs.  Weasley                 cook vast batch es of canapés, how ev er, Har ry start ed to sus pect her                 of a dif fer ent mo tive. All the jobs she hand ed out seemed to keep                  him, Ron, and Hermione away from one an oth er; he had not had a                 chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night, when                 he had told them about Volde mort tor tur ing Ol li van der.                      “I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you get ting to-                 geth er and plan ning, she’ll be able to de lay you leav ing,” Gin ny told                 Har ry in an un der tone, as they laid the ta ble for din ner on the third                 night of his stay.                       “And  then  what  does  she  think’s go ing  to hap pen?”  Har ry mut-                 tered. “Some one else might kill off Volde mort while she’s hold ing us                 here mak ing vol- au- vents?”                      He had spo ken with out think ing, and saw Gin ny’s face whiten.                      “So it’s true?” she said. “That’s what you’re try ing to do?”                      “I – not – I was jok ing,” said Har ry eva sive ly.                       They stared at each oth er, and there was some thing more than                 shock in Gin ny’s ex pres sion. Sud den ly Har ry be came aware that this                 was the first time that he had been alone with her since those stolen                 hours  in  se clud ed  cor ners  of  the  Hog warts  grounds.  He  was  sure                 she was re mem ber ing them too. Both of them jumped as the door                 opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kings ley, and Bill walked in.                      They were of ten joined by oth er Or der mem bers for din ner now,                  be cause the Bur row had re placed num ber twelve, Grim mauld Place","as the head quar ters. Mr. Weasley had ex plained that af ter the death                 of  Dum ble dore,  their  Se cret- Keep er,  each  of  the  peo ple  to  whom                 Dum ble dore had con fid ed Grim mauld Place’s lo ca tion had be come a                  Se cret- Keep er in turn.                      “And  as  there  are  around  twen ty  of  us,  that  great ly  di lutes  the                 pow er of the Fi delius Charm. Twen ty times as many op por tu ni ties for                 the Death Eaters to get the se cret out of some body. We can’t ex pect                 it to hold much longer.”                      “But sure ly Snape will have told the Death Eaters the ad dress by                 now?” asked Har ry.                      “Well, Mad- Eye set up a cou ple of curs es against Snape in case                  he turns up there again. We hope they’ll be strong enough both to                 keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place,                 but we can’t be sure. It would have been in sane to keep us ing the                 place as head quar ters now that its pro tec tion has be come so shaky.”                      The kitchen was so crowd ed that evening it was dif fi cult to ma-                  neu ver knives and forks. Har ry found him self crammed be side Gin-                 ny; the un said things that had just passed be tween them made him                 wish they had been sep arat ed by a few more peo ple. He was try ing                 so hard to avoid brush ing her arm he could bare ly cut his chick en.                      “No news about Mad- Eye?” Har ry asked Bill.                      “Noth ing,” replied Bill.                      They had not been able to hold a fu ner al for Moody, be cause Bill                  and Lupin had failed to re cov er his body. It had been dif fi cult to know                 where he might have fall en, giv en the dark ness and the con fu sion of                 the bat tle.                      “The Dai ly Prophet hasn’t said a word about him dy ing or about                 find ing  the  body,”  Bill  went  on.  “But  that  doesn’t  mean  much.  It’s                 keep ing a lot qui et these days.”                       “And  they  still  haven’t  called  a  hear ing  about  all  the  un der age                 mag ic I used es cap ing the Death Eaters?” Har ry called across the                 ta ble to Mr. Weasley, who shook his head.                      “Be cause they know I had no choice or be cause they don’t want                 me to tell the world Volde mort at tacked me?”                      “The  lat ter,  I  think.  Scrim geour  doesn’t  want  to  ad mit  that  You-                 Know- Who is as pow er ful as he is, nor that Azk aban’s seen a mass                  break out.”","“Yeah,  why  tell  the  pub lic  the  truth?”  said  Har ry,  clench ing  his                 knife so tight ly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood                 out, white against his skin: I must not tell lies.                       “Isn’t any one at the Min istry pre pared to stand up to him?” asked                 Ron an gri ly.                      “Of  course,  Ron,  but  peo ple  are  ter ri fied,”  Mr.  Weasley  replied,                 “ter ri fied that they will be next to dis ap pear, their chil dren the next to                 be at tacked! There are nasty ru mors go ing around; I for one don’t                 be lieve  the  Mug gle  Stud ies  pro fes sor  at  Hog warts  re signed.  She                 hasn’t  been  seen  for  weeks  now.  Mean while  Scrim geour  re mains                 shut up in his of fice all day; I just hope he’s work ing on a plan.”                       There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley mag icked the emp ty                 plates on to the work sur face and served ap ple tart.                      “We  must  de cide  ‘ow  you  will  be  dis guised,  ‘Ar ry,”  said  Fleur,                 once ev ery one had pud ding. “For ze wed ding,” she added, when he                 looked con fused. “Of course, none of our guests are Death Eaters,                  but we can not guar an tee zat zey will not let some thing slip af ter zey                 ‘ave ‘ad cham pagne.”                      From this, Har ry gath ered that she still sus pect ed Ha grid.                      “Yes,  good  point,”  said  Mrs.  Weasley  from  the  top  of  the  ta ble                 where she sat, spec ta cles perched on the end of her nose, scan ning                 an im mense list of jobs that she had scrib bled on a very long piece                 of parch ment. “Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?”                       “Why?” ex claimed Ron, slam ming his spoon down and glar ing at                 his moth er. “Why does my room have to be cleaned out? Har ry and I                 are fine with it the way it is!”                      “We are hold ing your broth er’s wed ding here in a few days’ time,                 young man –“                      “And are they get ting mar ried in my bed room?” asked Ron fu ri-                  ous ly. “No! So why in the name of Mer lin’s sag gy left –“                      “Don’t talk to your moth er like that,” said Mr. Weasley firm ly. “And                 do as you’re told.”                      Ron scowled at both his par ents, then picked up his spoon and                 at tacked the last few mouth fuls of his ap ple tart.                      “I  can  help,  some  of  it’s  my  mess.”  Har ry  told  Ron,  but  Mrs.                 Weasley cut across him.","“No, Har ry, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur much out the                 chick ens, and Hermione, I’d be ev er so grate ful if you’d change the                 sheets for Mon sieur and Madame Dela cour; you know they’re ar riv-                  ing at eleven to mor row morn ing.”                      But as it turned out, there was very lit tle to do for the chick ens.                 “There’s no need to, er, men tion it to Mol ly,” Mr. Weasley told Har ry,                 block ing his ac cess to the coop, “but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of                 what was left of Sir ius’s bike and, er, I’m hid ing – that’s to say, keep-                 ing – it in here.

I’m go ing to try and put it all                  back to geth er again when Mol ly’s not – I mean, when I’ve got time.”                      When they re turned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to                 be seen, so Har ry slipped up stairs to Ron’s at tic bed room.                      “I’m do ing it, I’m do ing – ! Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in re lief, as Har-                 ry en tered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had                  ev ident ly just va cat ed. The room was just as messy as it had been                 all week; the on ly chance was that Hermione was now sit ting in the                 far  cor ner,  her  fluffy  gin ger  cat,  Crook shanks,  at  her  feet,  sort ing                 books, some of which Har ry rec og nized as his own, in to two enor-                 mous piles.                      “Hi, Har ry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed.                      “And how did you man age to get away?”                       “Oh, Ron’s mum for got that she asked Gin ny and me to change                 the  sheets  yes ter day,”  said  Hermione.  She  threw  Nu merol ogy  and                 Gram mat ica on to one pile and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts on-                 to the oth er.                      “We were just talk ing about Mad- Eye,” Ron told Har ry. “I reck on                 he might have sur vived.”                       “But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,” said Har ry.                      “Yeah, but Bill was un der at tack too,” said Ron. “How can he be                 sure what he saw?”                      “Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad- Eye still fell about a thou-                 sand  feet,”  said  Hermione,  now  weight  Quid ditch  Teams  of  Britain                 and Ire land in her hand.                      “He could have used a Shield Charm –“                       “Fleur said his wand was blast ed out of his hand,” said Har ry.","“Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,” said Ron grumpi ly,                 punch ing his pil low in to a more com fort able shape.                      “Of course we don’t want him to be dead!” said Hermione, look ing                  shocked. “It’s dread ful that he’s dead! But we’re be ing re al is tic!”                      For  the  first  time,  Har ry  imag ined  Mad- Eye’s  body,  bro ken  as                 Dum ble dore’s  had  been,  yet  with  that  one  eye  still  whizzing  in  its                 sock et.  He  felt  a  stab  of  re vul sion  mixed  with  a  bizarre  de sire  to                 laugh.                      “The Death Eaters prob ably ti died up af ter them selves, that’s why                 no one’s found him,” said Ron wise ly.                      “Yeah,”  said  Har ry.  “Like  Bar ty  Crouch,  turned  in to  a  bone  and                  buried  in  Ha grid’s  front  gar den.  They  prob ably  trans fig ured  Moody                 and stuffed him –“                      “Don’t!”  squealed  Hermione.  Star tled,  Har ry  looked  over  just  in                 time  to  see  her  burst  in to  tears  over  her  copy  of  Spell man’s  Syl-                 labary.                       “Oh no,” said Har ry, strug gling to get up from the old camp bed.                 “Hermione, I wasn’t try ing to up set –“                      But with a great creak ing of rusty bed springs, Ron bound ed off                 the bed and got there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in                 his jeans pock et and with drew a re volt ing- look ing hand ker chief that                 he  had  used  to  clean  out  the  oven  ear li er.  Hasti ly  pulling  out  his                 wand, he point ed it at the rag and said, “Ter geo.”                       The  wand  si phoned  off  most  of  the  grease.  Look ing  rather                 pleased with him self, Ron hand ed the slight ly smok ing hand ker chief                 to Hermione.                      “Oh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I’m sor ry. . . .” She blew her nose and                 hic cupped. “It’s just so awf- ful, isn’t it? R- right af ter Dum ble dore . . .

And what I’ve learned is not to trust that cow ard ly                 lit tle squit, Mundun gus.”","Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned for ward to pick up two                 more books. A sec ond lat er, Ron had snatched his arm back from                 around her shoul ders; she had dropped The Mon ster of Mon sters on                  his  foot.  The  book  had  bro ken  free  from  its  re strain ing  belt  and                 snapped vi cious ly at Ron’s an kle.                      “I’m sor ry, I’m sor ry!” Hermione cried as Har ry wrenched the book                 from Ron’s leg and retied it shut.                      “What are you do ing with all those books any way?” Ron asked,                 limp ing back to his bed.                      “Just try ing to de cide which ones to take with us,” said Hermione,                 “When we’re look ing for the Hor crux es.”                       “Oh, of course,” said Ron, clap ping a hand to his fore head. “I for-                 got we’ll be hunt ing down Volde mort in a mo bile li brary.”                      “Ha ha,” said Hermione, look ing down at Spell man’s Syl labary. “I                 won der . . . will we need to trans late runes? It’s pos si ble. . . . I think                 we’d bet ter take it, to be safe.”                       She  dropped  the  syl labary  on to  the  larg er  of  the  two  piles  and                 picked up Hog warts, A His to ry.                      “Lis ten,” said Har ry.                      He  had  sat  up  straight.  Ron  and  Hermione  looked  at  him  with                 sim ilar mix tures of res ig na tion and de fi ance.                      “I know you said af ter Dum ble dore’s fu ner al that you want ed to                 come with me,” Har ry be gan.                       “Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes.                      “As we knew he would,” she sighed, turn ing back to the books.                 “You know, I think I will take Hog warts, A His to ry. Even if we’re not                 go ing back there, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it with –“                      “Lis ten!” said Har ry again.                      “No, Har ry, you lis ten,” said Hermione. “We’re com ing with you.                  That was de cid ed months ago – years, re al ly.”                      “But –“                      “Shut up,” Ron ad vised him.                      “– are you sure you’ve thought this through?” Har ry per sist ed.                      “Let’s see,” said Hermione, slam ming Trav els with Trolls on to the                 dis card ed pile with a rather fierce look. “I’ve been pack ing for days,                 so we’re ready to leave at a mo ment’s no tice, which for your in for ma-                  tion  has  in clud ed  do ing  some  pret ty  dif fi cult  mag ic,  not  to  men tion","smug gling  Mad- Eye’s  whole  stock  of  Polyjuice  Po tion  right  un der                 Ron’s mum’s nose.                      “I’ve  al so  mod ified  my  par ents’  mem ories  so  that  they’re  con-                  vinced  they’re  re al ly  called  Wen dell  and  Mon ica  Wilkins,  and  that                 their  life’s  am bi tion  is  to  move  to  Aus tralia,  which  they  have  now                 done.  That’s  to  make  it  more  dif fi cult  for  Volde mort  to  track  them                 down and in ter ro gate them about me – or you, be cause un for tu nate-                 ly, I’ve told them quite a bit about you.                      “As sum ing I sur vive our hunt for the Hor crux es, I’ll find Mum and                 Dad and lift the en chant ment.

Wen dell and Mon ica                  Wilkins don’t know that they’ve got a daugh ter, you see.”                      Hermione’s eyes were swim ming with tears again. Ron got back                 off the bed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at Har ry                 as though re proach ing him for lack of tact. Har ry could not think of                 any thing to say, not least be cause it was high ly un usu al for Ron to                  be teach ing any one else tact.                      “I – Hermione, I’m sor ry – I didn’t –“                      “Didn’t re al ize that Ron and I know per fect ly well what might hap-                 pen if we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Har ry what you’ve                 done.”                      “Nah, he’s just eat en,” said Ron.                      “Go on, he needs to know!”                       “Oh, all right. Har ry, come here.”                      For the sec ond time Ron with drew his arm from around Hermione                 and stumped over to the door.                      “C’mon.”                      “Why?” Har ry asked, fol low ing Ron out of the room on to the tiny                 land ing.                       “De scen do,” mut tered Ron, point ing his wand at the low ceil ing. A                 hatch opened right over their heads and a lad der slid down to their                 feet.  A  hor ri ble,  half- suck ing,  half- moan ing  sound  came  out  of  the                 square hole, along with an un pleas ant smell like open drains.                      “That’s your ghoul, isn’t it?” asked Har ry, who had nev er ac tu al ly                 met the crea ture that some times dis rupt ed the night ly si lence.                      “Yeah,  it  is,”  said  Ron,  climb ing  the  lad der.  “Come  and  have  a                  look at him.”","Har ry  fol lowed  Ron  up  the  few  short  steps  in to  the  tiny  at tic                 space. His head and shoul ders were in the room be fore he caught                 sight of the crea ture curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in the                  gloom with its large mouth wide open.                      “But it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls nor mal ly wear pa ja mas?”                      “No,” said Ron. “Nor have they usu al ly got red hair or that num-                 ber of pus tules.”                      Har ry con tem plat ed the thing, slight ly re volt ed. It was hu man in                 shape and size, and was wear ing what, now that Har ry’s eyes be-                 came used to the dark ness, was clear ly an old pair of Ron’s pa ja-                 mas. He was al so sure that ghouls were gen er al ly rather slimy and                  bald, rather than dis tinct ly hairy and cov ered in an gry pur ple blis ters.                      “He’s me, see?” said Ron.                      “No,” said Har ry. “I don’t.”                      “I’ll  ex plain  it  back  in  my  room,  the  smell’s  get ting  to  me,”  said                 Ron. They climbed back down the lad der, which Ron re turned to the                  ceil ing, and re joined Hermione, who was still sort ing books.                      “Once we’ve left, the ghoul’s go ing to come and live down here in                 my room,” said Ron. “I think he’s re al ly look ing for ward to it – well,                 it’s hard to tell, be cause all he can do is moan and drool – but he                 nods a lot when you men tion it. Any way, he’s go ing to be me with                 spat ter groit. Good, eh?”                      Har ry mere ly looked his con fu sion.                       “It is!” said Ron, clear ly frus trat ed that Har ry had not grasped the                 bril liance of the plan. “Look, when we three don’t turn up at Hog warts                 again, ev ery one’s go ing to think Hermione and I must be with you,                 right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our fam ilies                 to see if they’ve got in for ma tion on where you are.”                      “But hope ful ly it’ll look like I’ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a                  lot  of  Mug gle- borns  are  talk ing  about  go ing  in to  hid ing  at  the  mo-                 ment,” said Hermione.                      “We can’t hide my whole fam ily, it’ll look too fishy and they can’t                 all leave their jobs,” said Ron. “So we’re go ing to put out the sto ry                 that I’m se ri ous ly ill with spat ter groit, which is why I can’t go back to                 school.  If  any one  comes  call ing  to  in ves ti gate,  Mum  or  Dad  can                 show them the ghoul in my bed, cov ered in pus tules. Spat ter groit’s                  re al ly  con ta gious,  so  they’re  not  go ing  to  want  to  go  near  him.  It","won’t mat ter that he can’t say any thing, ei ther, be cause ap par ent ly                 you can’t once the fun gus has spread to your uvu la.”                      “And your mum and dad are in on this plan?” asked Har ry.                       “Dad is. He helped Fred and George trans form the ghoul. Mum . .                 . well, you’ve seen what she’s like. She won’t ac cept we’re go ing till                 we’re gone.”                      There was si lence in the room, bro ken on ly by gen tle thuds as                 Hermione con tin ued to throw books on to one pile or the oth er. Ron                 sat watch ing her, and Har ry looked from one to the oth er, un able to                 say any thing. The mea sure they had tak en to pro tect their fam ilies                 made  him  re al ize,  more  than  any thing  else  could  have  done,  that                  they re al ly were go ing to come with him and that they knew ex act ly                 how  dan ger ous  that  would  be.  He  want ed  to  tell  them  what  that                 meant to him, but he sim ply could not find words im por tant enough.                      Through  the si lence  came  the muf fled  sounds  of Mrs. Weasley                 shout ing from four floors be low.                       “Gin ny’s prob ably left a speck of dust on a poxy nap kin ring,” said                 Ron. “I dun no why the Dela cours have got to come two days be fore                 the wed ding.”                      “Fleur’s  sis ter’s  a  brides maid,  she  needs  to  be  here  for  the  re-                 hearsal, and she’s too young to come on her own,” said Hermione,                 as she pored in de ci sive ly over Break with a Ban shee.                      “Well, guests aren’t go ing to help Mum’s stress lev els,” said Ron.                       “What we re al ly need to de cide,” said Hermione, toss ing De fen-                 sive Mag ical The ory in to the bin with out a sec ond glance and pick ing                 up An Ap praisal of Mag ical Ed uca tion in Eu rope, “is where we’re go-                 ing af ter we leave here. I know you said you want ed to go to Go dric’s                 Hol low first, Har ry, and I un der stand why, but . . . well . . . shouldn’t                 we make the Hor crux es our pri or ity?”                       “If we knew where any of the Hor crux es were, I’d agree with you,”                 said Har ry, who did not be lieve that Hermione re al ly un der stood his                 de sire  to  re turn  to  Go dric’s  Hol low.  His  par ents’  graves  were  on ly                 part of the at trac tion: He had a strong, though in ex pli ca ble, feel ing                 that the place held an swers for him. Per haps it was sim ply be cause                 it was there that he had sur vived Volde mort’s Killing Curse; now that                 he was fac ing the chal lenge of re peat ing the feat, Har ry was drawn                  to the place where it had hap pened, want ing to un der stand.","“Don’t you think there’s a pos si bil ity that Volde mort’s keep ing a                 watch on Go dric’s Hol low?” Hermione asked. “He might ex pect you                 to  go  back  and  vis it  your  par ents’  graves  once  you’re  free  to  go                  wher ev er you like?”                      This had not oc curred to Har ry. While he strug gled to find a coun-                 ter ar gu ment,  Ron  spoke  up,  ev ident ly  fol low ing  his  own  train  of                 thought.                      “This R.A.B. per son,” he said. “You know, the one who stole the                 re al lock et?”                      Hermione nod ded.                      “He said in his note he was go ing to de stroy it, didn’t he?”                       Har ry dragged his ruck sack to ward him and pulled out the fake                 Hor crux in which R.A.B.’s note was still fold ed.                      “’I have stolen the re al Hor crux and in tend to de stroy it as soon                 as I can.’” Har ry read out.                      “Well, what if he did fin ish it off?” said Ron.                       “Or she.” In ter posed Hermione.                      “Whichev er,” said Ron. “it’d be one less for us to do!”                      “Yes, but we’re still go ing to have to try and trace the re al lock et,                 aren’t we?” said Hermione, “to find out whether or not it’s de stroyed.”                      “And  once  we  get  hold  of  it,  how  do  you  de stroy  a  Hor crux?”                 asked Ron.                      “Well,” said Hermione, “I’ve been re search ing that.”                       “How?” asked Har ry. “I didn’t think there were any books on Hor-                 crux es in the li brary?”                      “There weren’t,” said Hermione, who had turned pink. “Dum ble-                 dore re moved them all, but he – he didn’t de stroy them.”  Ron sat up                 straight, wide- eyed.                      “How  in  the  name  of  Mer lin’s  pants  have  you  man aged  to  get                  your hands on those Hor crux books?”                      “It – it wasn’t steal ing!” said Hermione, look ing from Har ry to Ron                 with  a  kind  of  des per ation.  “They  were  still  li brary  books,  even  if                 Dum ble dore  had  tak en  them  off  the  shelves.  Any way,  if  he  re al ly                 didn’t want any one to get at them, I’m sure he would have made it                 much hard er to –“                      “Get to the point!” said Ron.","“Well . . . it was easy,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I just did a                 Sum mon ing Charm.

I think you’re right, Hermione, that could eas ily                 have been where he got the in for ma tion.”                      “And the more I’ve read about them,” said Hermione, “the more                 hor ri ble they seem, and the less I can be lieve that he ac tu al ly made                 six. It warns in this book how un sta ble you make the rest of your soul                  by rip ping it, and that’s just by mak ing one Hor crux!”","Har ry re mem bered what Dum ble dore had said about Volde mort                 mov ing be yond “usu al evil.”                      “Isn’t  there  any  way  of  putting  your self  back  to geth er?”  Ron                  asked.                      “Yes,” said Hermione with a hol low smile, “but it would be ex cru ci-                 at ing ly painful.”                      “Why? How do you do it?” asked Har ry.                      “Re morse,” said Hermione. “You’ve got to re al ly feel what you’ve                 done. There’s a foot note. Ap par ent ly the pain of it can de stroy you. I                 can’t see Volde mort at tempt ing it some how, can you?”                      “No,” said Ron, be fore Har ry could an swer. “So does it say how                  to de stroy Hor crux es in that book?”                      “Yes,” said Hermione, now turn ing the frag ile pages as if ex am in-                 ing rot ting en trails, “be cause it warns Dark wiz ards how strong they                 have  to  make  the  en chant ments  on  them.  From  all  that  I’ve  read,                 what Har ry did to Rid dle’s di ary was one of the few re al ly fool proof                  ways of de stroy ing a Hor crux.”                      “What, stab bing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Har ry.                      “Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large sup ply of basilisk fangs,                 then,”  said  Ron.  “I  was  won der ing  what  we  were  go ing  to  do  with                 them.”                      “It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione pa tient ly. “It                 has to be some thing so de struc tive that the Hor crux can’t re pair it-                  self. Basilisk ven om on ly has one an ti dote, and it’s in cred ibly rare –“                      “– phoenix tears,” said Har ry, nod ding.                      “Ex act ly,” said Hermione. “Our prob lem is that there are very few                 sub stances as de struc tive as basilisk ven om, and they’re all dan ger-                 ous to car ry around with you. That’s a prob lem we’re go ing to have                 to solve, though, be cause rip ping, smash ing, or crush ing a Hor crux                  won’t do the trick. You’ve got to put it be yond mag ical re pair.”                      “But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can’t                 the bit of soul in it just go and live in some thing else?”                      “Be cause a Hor crux is the com plete op po site of a hu man be ing.”                      See ing  that  Har ry  and  Ron  looked  thor ough ly  con fused,                 Hermione hur ried on. “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron,                 and ran you through with it, I wouldn’t dam age your soul at all.”","”Which would be a re al com fort to me, I’m sure,” said Ron. Har ry                 laughed.                      “It should be, ac tu al ly! But my point is that what ev er hap pens to                  your body, your soul will sur vive, un touched,” said Hermione. “But it’s                 the oth er way round with a Hor crux. The frag ment of soul in side it                 de pends on its con tain er, its en chant ed body, for sur vival. It can’t ex-                 ist with out it.”                      “That di ary sort of died when I stabbed it,” said Har ry, re mem ber-                 ing  ink  pour ing  like  blood  from  the  punc tured  pages,  and  the                 screams of the piece of Volde mort’s soul as it van ished.                      “And  once  the  di ary  was  prop er ly  de stroyed,  the  bit  of  soul                  trapped in it could no longer ex ist. Gin ny tried to get rid of the di ary                 be fore you did, flush ing it away, but ob vi ous ly it came back good as                 new.”                      “Hang on,” said Ron, frown ing. “The bit of soul in that di ary was                 pos sess ing Gin ny, wasn’t it? How does that work, then?”                       “While the mag ical con tain er is still in tact, the bit of soul in side it                 can flit in and out of some one if they get too close to the ob ject. I                 don’t mean hold ing it for too long, it’s noth ing to do with touch ing it,”                 she added be fore Ron could speak. “I mean close emo tion al ly. Gin ny                 poured her heart out in to that di ary, she made her self in cred ibly vul-                 ner able. You’re in trou ble if you get too fond of or de pen dent on the                 Hor crux.”                       “I won der how Dum ble dore de stroyed the ring?” said Har ry. “Why                 didn’t I ask him? I nev er re al ly . . .”                      His voice trailed away: He was think ing of all the things he should                 have  asked  Dum ble dore,  and  of  how,  since  the  head mas ter  had                 died, it seemed to Har ry that he had wast ed so many op por tu ni ties                 when Dum ble dore had been alive, to find out more . . . to find out ev-                  ery thing. . . .                      The si lence was shat tered as the bed room door flew open with a                 wall- shak ing crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Se crets of the                 Dark est Art; Crook shanks streaked un der the bed, hiss ing in dig nant-                 ly; Ron jumped off the bed, skid ded on a dis card ed Choco late Frog                 wrap per, and smacked his head on the op po site wall; and Har ry in-                 stinc tive ly dived for his wand be fore re al iz ing that he was look ing up","at  Mrs.  Weasley,  whose  hair  was  di sheveled  and  whose  face  was                 con tort ed with rage.                      “I’m so sor ry to break up this cozy lit tle gath er ing,” she said, her                  voice trem bling. “I’m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are                 wed ding  presents  stacked  in  my  room  that  need  sort ing  out  and  I                 was un der the im pres sion that you had agreed to help.”                      “Oh yes,” said Hermione, look ing ter ri fied as she leapt to her feet,                 send ing books fly ing in ev ery di rec tion. “we will . . . we’re sor ry . . .”                      With an an guished look at Har ry and Ron, Hermione hur ried out                 of the room af ter Mrs. Weasley.                      “it’s like be ing a house- elf,” com plained Ron in an un der tone, still                  mas sag ing his head as he and Har ry fol lowed. “Ex cept with out the                 job sat is fac tion. The soon er this wed ding’s over, the hap pi er, I’ll be.”                      “Yeah,” said Har ry, “then we’ll have noth ing to do ex cept find Hor-                 crux es. . . . It’ll be like a hol iday, won’t it?”                      Ron start ed to laugh, but at the sight of the enor mous pile of wed-                  ding presents wait ing for them in Mrs. Weasley’s room, stopped quite                 abrupt ly.                      The Dela cours ar rived the fol low ing morn ing at eleven o’ clock.                 Har ry, Ron, Hermione and Gin ny were feel ing quite re sent ful to ward                 Fleur’s fam ily by this time; and it was with ill grace that Ron stumped                 back up stairs to put on match ing socks, and Har ry at tempt ed to flat-                 ten  his  hair.  Once  they  had  all  been  deemed  smart  enough,  they                  trooped out in to the sun ny back yard to await the vis itors.                      Har ry had nev er seen the place look ing so tidy. The rusty caul-                 drons and old Welling ton boots that usu al ly lit tered the steps by the                 back door were gone, re placed by two new Flut ter by bush es stand-                 ing ei ther side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze,                 the leaves waved lazi ly, giv ing an at trac tive rip pling ef fect. The chick-                  ens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the near by                 gar den  had  been  pruned,  plucked,  and  gen er al ly  spruced  up,  al-                 though  Har ry,  who  liked  it  in  its  over grown  state,  thought  that  it                 looked  rather  for lorn  with out  its  usu al  con tin gent  of  ca per ing                 gnomes.                      He had lost track of how many se cu ri ty en chant ments had been                 placed up on the Bur row by both the Or der and the Min istry; all he                  knew  was  that  it  was  no  longer  pos si ble  for  any body  to  trav el  by","mag ic  di rect ly  in to  the  place.  Mr.  Weasley  had  there fore  gone  to                 meet the Dela cours on top of a near by hill, where they were to ar rive                 by Portkey. The first sound of their ap proach was an un usu al ly high-                  pitched laugh, which turned out to be com ing from Mr. Weasley, who                 ap peared at the gate mo ments lat er, laden with lug gage and lead ing                 a beau ti ful blonde  wom an  in  long,  leaf  green  robes,  who  could  be                 Fleur’s moth er.                      “Ma man!” cried Fleur, rush ing for ward to em brace her. “Pa pa!”                      Mon sieur Dela cour was nowhere near as at trac tive as his wife;                 he  was  a  head  short er  and  ex treme ly  plumb,  with  a  lit tle,  point ed                 black  beard.  How ev er,  he  looked  good- na tured.  Bounc ing  to wards                  Mrs.  Weasley  on  high- heeled  boots,  he  kissed  her  twice  on  each                 cheek, leav ing her flus tered.                      “You ‘ave been so much trou ble,” he said in a deep voice. “Fleur                 tells us you ‘ave been work ing very ‘ard.”                      “Oh, it’s been noth ing, noth ing!” trilled Mrs. Weasley. “No trou ble                  at all!”                               l                      Ron re ieved his feel ings by aim ing a kick at a gnome who was                 peer ing out from be hind one of the new Flut ter by bush es.                      “Dear la dy!” said Mon sieur Dela cour, still hold ing Mrs. Weasley’s                 hand be tween his own two plump ones and beam ing. “We are most                 hon ored at the ap proach ing union of our two fam ilies! Let me present                 my wife, Apolline.”                       Madame  Dela cour  glid ed  for ward  and  stooped  to  kiss  Mrs.                 Weasley too.                      “En chan tée,”  she  said.  “Your  ‘us band  ‘as  been  telling  us  such                 amus ing sto ries!”                      Mr. Weasley gave a ma ni acal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a                 look, up on which he be came im me di ate ly silent and as sumed an ex-                  pres sion ap pro pri ate to the sickbed of a close friend.                      “And, of course, you ‘ave met my lee tle daugh ter, Gabrielle!” said                 Mon sieur  Dela cour.  Gabrielle  was  Fleur  in  minia ture;  eleven  years                 old,  with  waist- length  hair  of  pure,  sil very  blonde,  she  gave  Mrs.                 Weasley a daz zling smile and hugged her, then threw Har ry a glow-                 ing look, bat ting her eye lash es. Gin ny cleared her throat loud ly.                      “Well, come in, do!” said Mrs. Weasley bright ly, and she ush ered                  the  Dela cours  in to  the  house,  with  many  “No,  please!”s  and  “Af ter","you!”s and “Not at all!”s.                      The Dela cours, it soon tran spired, were help ful, pleas ant guests.                 They  were  pleased  with  ev ery thing  and  keen  to  as sist  with  the                  prepa ra tions for the wed ding. Mon sieur Dela cour pro nounced ev ery-                 thing  from  the  seat ing  plan  to  the  brides maids’  shoes  “Char mant!”                 Madame Dela cour was most ac com plished at house hold spells and                 had the oven prop er ly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle fol lowed her el der                 sis ter  around,  try ing  to  as sist  in  any  way  she  could  and  jab ber ing                 away in rapid French.                      On the down side, the Bur row was not built to ac com mo date so                 many peo ple. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were now sleep ing in the sit ting                  room,  hav ing  shout ed  down  Mon sieur  and  Madame  Dela cour’s                 protests and in sist ed they take their bed room. Gabrielle was sleep-                 ing  with  Fleur  in  Per cy’s  old  room,  and  Bill  would  be  shar ing  with                 Char lie, his best man, once Char lie ar rived from Ro ma nia.

You kept say ing 'Gre gorovitch.'”                      Har ry was not wear ing his glass es; Ron's face ap peared slight ly                 blurred.                      “Who's Gre gorovitch?”                       “I dun no, do I?” You were the one say ing it.\"                      Har ry rubbed his fore head, think ing. He had a vague idea he had                 heard the name be fore, but he could not think where.                       “I think Volde mort's look ing for him.”                      “Poor bloke,” said Ron fer vent ly.                      Har ry sat up, still rub bing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to                 re mem ber ex act ly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came                 back was a moun tain ous hori zon and the out line of the lit tle vil lage                  cra dled in a deep val ley.                      “I think he's abroad.”                      “Who, Gre gorovitch?”                      “Volde mort.  I  think  he's  some where  abroad,  look ing  for  Gre-                 gorovitch. It didn't look like any where in Britain.”                      “You reck on you were see ing in to his mind again?”                      Ron sound ed wor ried.","“Do  me  a  fa vor  and  don't  tell  Hermione,”  said  Har ry.  “Al though                 how she ex pects me to stop see ing stuff in my sleep...”                      He gazed up at lit tle Pig wid geon's cage, think ing...Why was the                  name “Gre gorovitch” fa mil iar?                      “I think,” he said slow ly, “he's got some thing to do with Quid ditch.                 There's some con nec tion, but I can't--I can't think what it is.”                      “Quid ditch?” said Ron. “Sure you're not think ing of Gor gov itch?”                      “Who?”                      “Dragomir  Gor gov itch,  Chas er,  trans ferred  to  the  Chud ley  Can-                 nons for a record fee two years ago. Record hold er for most Quaf fle                 drops in a sea son.”                       “No,” said Har ry. “I'm def inite ly not think ing of Gor gov itch.”                       “I try not to ei ther,” said Ron. “Well, hap py birth day any way.”                      “Wow -- that's right, I for got! I'm sev en teen!”                      Har ry seized the wand ly ing be side his camp bed, point ed it at                  the  clut tered  desk  where  he  had  left  his  glass es,  and  said,  “Ac cio                 Glass es!”  Al though  they  were  on ly  around  a  foot  away,  there  was                 some thing  im mense ly  sat is fy ing  about  see ing  them  zoom  to ward                 him, at least un til they poked him in the eye.                      “Slick,” snort ed Ron.                      Rev el ing in the re moval of his Trace, Har ry sent Ron's pos ses-                 sions fly ing around the room, caus ing Pig wid geon to wake up and                  flut ter ex cit ed ly around his cage. Har ry al so tried ty ing the laces of                 his train ers by mag ic (the re sul tant knot took sev er al min utes to un tie                 by hand) and, pure ly for the plea sure of it, turned the or ange robes                 on Ron's Chud ley Can nons posters bright blue.                      “I'd do your fly by hand, though,” Ron ad vised Har ry, snig ger ing                 when Har ry im me di ate ly checked it. “Here's your present. Un wrap it                  up here, it's not for my moth er's eyes.”                      “A book?” said Har ry as he took the rect an gu lar par cel. “Bit of a                 de par ture from tra di tion, isn't it?”                      “This isn't your av er age book,” said Ron. “It'd pure gold: Twelve                 Fail- Safe Ways to Charm Witch es.

Well, Fred and George gave me a copy, and I've learned a lot.                 You'd be sur prised, it's not all about wand work, ei ther.”                      When  they  ar rived  in  the  kitchen  they  found  a  pile  of  presents                  wait ing on the ta ble. Bill and Mon sieur Dela cour were fin ish ing their                 break fasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood chat ting to them over the fry ing                 pan.                       “Arthur  told  me  to  wish  you  a  hap py  sev en teenth,  Har ry,”  said                 Mrs. Weasley, beam ing at him. “He had to leave ear ly for work, but                 he'll be back for din ner. That's our present on top.”                      Har ry sat down,  took the square  par cel  she  had  in di cat ed, and                  un wrapped  it.  In side  was  a  watch  very  like  the  one  Mr.  and  Mrs.                 Weasley had giv en Ron for his sev en teenth; it was gold, with stars                 cir cling around the race in stead of hands.                      “It's tra di tion al to give a wiz ard a watch when he comes of age,”                 said Mrs. Weasley, watch ing him anx ious ly from be side the cook er.                  “I'm afraid that one isn't new like Ron's, it was ac tu al ly my broth er                 Fabi an's and he wasn't ter ri bly care ful with his pos ses sions, it's a bit                 dent ed on the back, but--”                      The rest of her speech was lost; Har ry had got up and hugged                 her. He tried to put a lot of un said things in to the hug and per haps                 she un der stood them, be cause she pat ted his cheek clum si ly when                 he  re leased  her,  then  waved  her  wand  in  a  slight ly  ran dom  way,                  caus ing half a pack of ba con to flop out of the fry ing pan on to the                 floor.                      “Hap py birth day, Har ry!” said Hermione, hur ry ing in to the kitchen                 and adding her own present to the top of the pile. “It's not much, but I                 hope  you  like  it.  What  did  you  get  him?”  she  added  to  Ron,  who                 seemed not to hear her.                       “Come on, then, open Hermione's!” said Ron.                      She  had  bought  him  a  new  Sneako scope.  The  oth er  pack ages                 con tained an en chant ed ra zor from Bill and Fleur (“Ah yes, zis will                 give you ze smoothest shave you will ev er 'ave,” Mon sieur Dela cour                 as sured him, “but you must tell it clear ly what you want...ozzer wise                 you  might  find  you  'ave  a  lee tle  less  hair  zan  you  would  like...”),                 choco lates from the Dela cours, and an enor mous box of the lat est                  Weasleys' Wiz ard Wheezes mer chan dise from Fred and George.","Har ry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the ta ble, as the ar-                 rival of Madame Dela cour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen un-                  com fort ably crowd ed.                      “I'll  pack  these  for  you,”  Hermione  said  bright ly,  tak ing  Har ry's                 presents out of his arms as the three of them head ed back up stairs.                 “I'm near ly done, I'm just wait ing for the rest of your un der pants to                 come out of the wash, Ron--”                      Ron's  splut ter  was  in ter rupt ed  by  the  open ing  of  a  door  on  the                 first- floor land ing.                      “Har ry, will you come in here a mo ment?”                       It was Gin ny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him                 by the el bow and tugged him on up the stairs. Feel ing ner vous, Har-                 ry fol lowed Gin ny in to her room.                      He had nev er been in side it be fore. It was small, but bright. There                 was a large poster of the Wiz ard ing band the Weird Sis ters on one                  wall, and a pic ture of Gwenog Jones, Cap tain of the all- witch Quid-                 ditch team the Holy head Harpies, on the oth er. A desk stood fac ing                 the open win dow, which looked out over the or chard where he and                 Gin ny  had  once  played  a  two- a- side  Quid ditch  with  Ron  and                 Hermione,  and  which  now  housed  a  large,  pearly  white  mar quee.                 The gold en flag on top was lev el with Gin ny's win dow.                      Gin ny looked up in to Har ry's face, took a deep breath, and said,                  “Hap py sev en teenth.”                      “Yeah...thanks.”                      She was look ing at him steadi ly; he how ev er, found it dif fi cult to                 look back at her; it was like gaz ing in to a bril liant light.                      “Nice view,” he said fee bly, point ing to ward with win dow.                      She ig nored this. He could not blame her.                       “I couldn't think what to get you,” she said.                       “You didn't have to get me any thing.”                      She dis re gard ed this too.                      “I didn't know what would be use ful. Noth ing too big, be cause you                 wouldn't be able to take it with you.”                      He chanced a glance at her. She was not tear ful; that was one of                  the many won der ful things about Gin ny, she was rarely weepy. He","had  some times  thought  that  hav ing  six  broth ers  must  have  tough-                 ened her up.                      She took a step clos er to him.                       “So then I thought, I'd like you to have some thing to re mem ber                 me  by,  you  know,  if  you  meet  some  veela  when  you're  off  do ing                 what ev er you're do ing.”                      “I  think  dat ing  op por tu ni ties  are  go ing  to  be  pret ty  thin  on  the                 ground, to be hon est.”                      “There's  the  sil ver  lin ing  I've  been  look ing  for,”  she  whis pered,                 and then she was kiss ing him as she had nev er kissed him be fore,                 and  Har ry  was  kiss ing  her  back,  and  it  was  bliss ful  obliv ion  bet ter                  than firewhisky; she was the on ly re al thing in the world, Gin ny, the                 feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet- smelling                 hair--                      The door banged open be hind them and they jumped apart.                      “Oh,” said Ron point ed ly. “Sor ry.”                       “Ron!” Hermione was just be hind him, slight out of breath. There                 was a strained si lence, then Gin ny had said in a flat lit tle voice,                      “Well, hap py birth day any way, Har ry.”                      Ron's ears were scar let; Hermione looked ner vous. Har ry want ed                 to slam the door in their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had                 en tered  the  room  when  the  door  opened,  and  his  shin ing  mo ment                 had popped like a soap bub ble. All the rea sons for end ing his re la-                  tion ship with Gin ny, for stay ing well away from her, seemed to have                 slunk  in side  the  room  with  Ron,  and  all  hap py  for get ful ness  was                 gone.                      He looked at Gin ny, want ing to say some thing, though he hard ly                 knew what, but she had turned her back on him. He thought that she                 might have suc cumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do any thing                  to com fort her in front of Ron.                      “I'll see you lat er,” he said, and fol lowed the oth er two out of the                 bed room.                      Ron marched down stairs, though the still- crowd ed kitchen and in-                 to the yard, and Har ry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trot-                 ting along be hind them look ing scared.                      Once  he  reached  the  seclu sion  of  the  fresh ly  mown  lawn,  Ron                  round ed on Har ry.","“You ditched her. What are you do ing now, mess ing her around?”                      “I'm not mess ing her around,” said Har ry, as Hermione caught up                 with them.                       “Ron--”                      But Ron held up a hand to si lence her.                      “She was re al ly cut up when you end ed it--”                      “So  was  I.  You  know  why  I  stopped  it,  and  it  wasn't  be cause  I                 want ed to.”                      “Yeah, but you go snog ging her now and she's just go ing to get                 her hopes up again--”                      “She's not an id iot, she knows it can't hap pen, she's not ex pect-                  ing us to--to end up mar ried, or--”                      As he said it, a vivid pic ture formed in Har ry's mind of Gin ny in a                 white dress, mar ry ing a tall, face less, and un pleas ant stranger.                       In one spi ral ing mo ment it seemed to hit him: Her fu ture was free                  and un en cum bered, where as his...he could see noth ing but Volde-                 mort ahead.                      “If you keep grop ing her ev ery chance you get--”                      “It won't hap pen again,” said Har ry harsh ly. The day was cloud-                 less, but he felt as though the sun had gone in. “Okay?”                      Ron looked half re sent ful, half sheep ish; he rocked back ward and                 for ward  on  his  feet  for  a  mo ment,  then  said,  “Right  then,  well,                  that's...yeah.”                      Gin ny did not seek an oth er one- to- one meet ing with Har ry for the                 rest of the day, nor by any look or ges ture did she show that they                 had shared more than po lite con ver sa tion in her room. Nev er the less,                 Char lie's ar rival came as a re lief to Har ry. It pro vid ed a dis trac tion,                 watch ing  Mrs.  Weasley  force  Char lie  in to  a  chair,  raise  her  wand                  threat en ing ly, and an nounce that he was about to get a prop er hair-                 cut.                      As  Har ry's  birth day  din ner  would  have  stretched  the  Bur row's                 kitchen  to  break ing  point  even  be fore  the  ar rival  of  Char lie,  Lupin,                 Tonks, and Ha grid, sev er al ta bles were placed end to end in the gar-                 den. Fred and George be witched a num ber of pur ple lanterns all em-                 bla zoned with a large num ber 17, to hang in midair over the guests.                  Thanks to Mrs. Weasley's min is tra tions, George's wound was neat","and clean, but Har ry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of                 his head, de spite the twins' many jokes about it.                      Hermione made pur ple and gold stream ers erupt from the end of                  her wand and drape them selves ar tis ti cal ly over the trees and bush-                 es.                      “Nice,” said Ron, as with one fi nal flour ish of her wand, Hermione                       turned the leaves on the crabap ple tree to gold. “You've re al ly got                 an eye for that sort of thing.”                      “Thank you, Ron!” said Hermione, look ing both pleased and a lit-                 tle con fused. Har ry turned away, smil ing to him self. He had a fun ny                  no tion that he would find a chap ter on com pli ments when he found                 time to pe ruse his copy of Twelve Fail- Safe Ways to Charm Witch es;                 he caught Gin ny's eye and grinned at her be fore re mem ber ing his                                                       l                 promise to Ron and hur ried y strik ing up a con ver sa tion with Mon-                 sieur Dela cour.                       “Out  of  the  way,  out  of  the  way!”  sang  Mrs.  Weasley,  com ing                 through the gate with what ap peared to be a gi ant, beach- ball- sized                 Snitch float ing in front of her. Sec onds lat er Har ry re al ized that it was                 his  birth day  cake,  which  Mrs.  Weasley  was  sus pend ing  with  her                 wand, rather than risk car ry ing it over the un even ground. When the                 cake had fi nal ly land ed in the mid dle of the ta ble, Har ry said,                      “That looks amaz ing, Mrs. Weasley.”                       “Oh, it's noth ing, dear,” she said fond ly. Over her shoul der, Ron                 gave Har ry the thumbs- up and mouthed, Good one.                      By sev en o'clock all the guests had ar rived, led in to the house by                 Fred and George, who had wait ed for them at the end of the lane.                 Ha grid had hon ored the oc ca sion by wear ing his best, and hor ri ble,                 hairy brown suit.
